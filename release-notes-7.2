<h1>What's new in dCache 7.2<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

This version introduces a quota system and support for file labels.
Support for a dedicated scheduling strategy for bring-online requests was added to SRM-Manager.

## Incompatibilities

This release doesn't have any incompatibilities.

## Release 7.2.4

### bulk

The way Bulk handles pin requests was changed to provide greater
throughput and reliability.

### ftp

The FTP door now provides more succinct information on pinboard, should
use less CPU and take better advantage of the available cores.

### libraries

The canl version was updated to version 2.6.0 to fix a bug that made
dCache no longer accept certificates issued by a trusted CA after that
CA updated their CA certificate while keeping the public/private
key-pair the same.

### pnfsmanager

Attempts to create a file where the parent directory is either missing
or not a directory now provide clearer error messages.

### pool

The pool is updated to support stateful NearlineStorage plugins
that can fail during initialisation.

The pool now provides more information for bugs reported as
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Handle is closed.

### webdav

The HTTP-TPC response is improved if a client attempts to pull a file
into a non-existing directory, or attempts to use an existing file as an
ancestor directory.

### xrootd

Improved exception handling for Xrootd.

The xrootd4j version was updated to 4.2.4

## Release 7.2.3

### chimera

Added information to the cleaner admin info output, showing which pools are in the
process of being cleaned.

A bug is fixed that triggered downstream errors when getUid() is called.

### gftp door

The GFTP door was running into out-of-memory errors. This is fixed now.

### frontend

api/v1/namespace/path is extended by adding 'pin' and 'unpin' activities to the POST method.

### frontend, chimera

The behaviour of pin/unpin to api/v1/namespace/path POST was fixed to not remove the qos pin.

### universal-spring-cell

This patch fixes a problem where a call to api/PoolManager returned 404
not found. The JSON serialized object is returned now as before.

### xrootd

The xroot4j version was updated to 4.2.3

## Release 7.2.2

### billing


Billing will no longer throw a NullPointerException with certain
information from an NFS door serving an NFSv3 client.



### dcache


Running TPC HTTP(s) transfers with gridsite delegation against
hosts on dual stack noticed this exception:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:  '[xxxx:xxxxx:xxx:xxx:fe03:7377]'
is not an IP string literal. this is now fixed

### ftp


Now  file sizes for LIST output in bytes is displayed.



The FTP door should be more robust against a (currently unknown) bug
that results in the ftp session attempting to send progress queries to
the pool after that is no longer possible.




### gplazma



The banfile and scitoken plugins, and the two admin commands test login and explain login are updated to accept the username: prefix
(e.g., username:paul). The prefix user: continues to work but is
now deprecated.

### nfs

An  exception for access check in ChimeraVfs has been fixed.

Tag update regression was fixed.

### pool


The current release improved error messaging if a setup file badly
configures an HSM instance.


A bug is fixed where removing a create hsm statement in a pool's setup
file and running the reload command kills the pool.


### srm-server

NullPointerException when a tape with expired requests does not have an oldest request age value  has been fixed.

### srmclient




The RPM packaging system and related software (e.g,. yum) now
understands that the srm-client package requires java.

### xroot


xrootd4j has been upgraded to 4.2.2 with a fixed  regression introduced into the unix protocol plugin.



The documentation  concerning TLS properties has been fixed.

:   [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration

## Release 7.2.1

### acl

The group ACEs now  apply to desired group instead of to a users with the
same numeric id.

### gplazma

The `WLCG Common JWT Profiles` (v1.0) describes the `wlcg.groups` claim
for expressing group-membership. We are increasingly seeing this being
used as the OIDC equivalent to the group-membership expressed through
the VOMS extension.

During the auth phase of the login process, the group membership
information contained in a `wlcg.groups` claim from the OP is now
available as OpenIdGroupPrincipal principals. Subsequent plugins (e.g.,
multimap) may be used to convert these principals to more directly
useful principals.

### srm-server

The current release fixed a potential  NPE by not deleting tape objects and checking for as well as handling null values appropriately.

### webdav

dCache now responds with a 507 (Insufficient Storage) on GET request if
dCache must do a pool-to-pool internal-transfer or stage the file but no
pools have sufficient free capacity to support this.

## Release 7.2.0

### Runtime

#### Java flight recorder

When debugging an issue on a running system often we need to collect jvm performance stats with 'Java flight recorder'.
Starting from release 7.2 the Java flight recorder attach listener is enabled by default. Site admins can collect and
provide developers with additional information when high CPU load or memory consuption is observed as:

```
jcmd <pid> JFR.start duration=60s filename=/tmp/dcache.jfr,
```

> Please note, that `jcmd` command is a part of `java-11-openjdk-devel` package (on RHEL and clones)

#### Handling of OutOfMemoryError

Depending which thread have received OutOfMemoryError the JVM might or
might not exit. In a later cache, dCache might remain in an
unpredictable state, where a component might be exposed as functional
when its not. 

With 7.2 we have update the java options to include ExitOnOutOfMemoryError, which
forces JVM to exit when an OOM is detected.

> NOTE: There are several situations when jvm generates an
OutOfMemoryError. The ExitOnOutOfMemoryError option works ONLY when
allocation in heap space fails.

### Admin

Updated mina-sshd library to version 2.7.0 with various security enhancements.

### Alarms

Documentation has been added specifying that the alarms service is not replicable.

### Billing

Documentation has been added specifying that billing is replicable only if it shares an underlying store (i.e., an RDBMS instance).

### Bulk

In preparation for future integration of tape recall optimization scheduling, some of the bulk processing has been adjusted to ensure the highest possible throughput to the scheduling endpoint.  These changes are largely invisible to the user.

### Cleaner

Previously, pools were cleaned synchronously one after another by the cleaner component. Doing so in parallel is expected to provide performance benefits.

The property `cleaner.limits.threads` now also controls the number of pools processed in parallel.

### Checksums

dCache now supports the stronger hash functions SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512.

### Chimera (Shell)

It is now possible to add a label to a file.

The following admin commands for adding, removing and querying labels of a file object are available:

`labels get path` lists the labels of a file.

`label rm path labelname` removes the given label from a file.

`label add path labelname`  adds a new label to a file.

`ls_virtualdir labelname` lists all the files having the given label.

### Frontend

#### File labels support

If the file object has labels, these can now be queried, set and removed through a RESTful API.

To query labels, the `curl  -v   http://localhost:3880/api/v1/namespace/path/filename\?label=true` should be used.

To add a new label:

`curl   -X  POST  -H "Accept: application/json"  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://localhost:3880/api/v1/namespace/path/filename -d  '{"action" : "set-label",    "label" : "label" }'`

And to remove an existing label:

`curl   -X  POST  -H "Accept: application/json"  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://localhost:3880/api/v1/namespace/path/filename -d  '{"action" : "rm-label",    "label" : "label" }'`

#### Quota support

A RESTful API for the quota system (see further below) has been implemented; it allows for creating (POST), modifying (PATCH), listing (GET) and removing (DELETE) both user and group quotas.

All commands except GET require admin privileges.  For GET, anonymous users are blocked.  Otherwise, a full list of quotas can be obtained using:

`curl   -X  GET  -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3880/api/v1/quota/user `

`curl   -X  GET  -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3880/api/v1/quota/group `

The list can be limited to the quota for the user's uid or primary gid by appending the query '\?user=true', or, if known, a GET can be issued with the id as final path element:

`curl   -X  GET  -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3880/api/v1/quota/user/4215 `

etc.

A full description of the API is available through the Swagger interface (https://localhost:3880/api/v1).

#### Bug fixes

In reporting movers (api/v1/pools/{pool}/movers), a problem with counts has been fixed so that both active and queued movers are included, and so that these are correctly broken down by their I/O activity (read/write).

In reporting pool usage (api/v1/pools/{pool}/usage), the csm (checksum) module object was missing profile information; this is now included.

### PNFS Manager

#### User and group quota
Release 7.2 introduces a user and group quota implementation. The quota system operates on the chimera namespace. It periodically counts space usage broken down by Retention Policy, UID and GID, and stores these counts in two chimera DB tables –– t_user_quota and t_group_quota. Besides space counts these tables hold quota limits for each space count category by UID and by GID. A null for a limit means "no quota". No entries in these tables for a UID or GIDs means "no quota" for that UID or GID. CUSTODIAL Retention Policy corresponds to files going to tape, REPLICA corresponds to disk-only files, and OUTPUT currently is not used in dCache.  The quota system is controlled by the master switch:

```
        dcache.enable.quota
```

which by default is false. To enable the quota system, this variable has to be set to true on hosts running  the ```PnfsManager``` and ```NFS``` services.

Queries executed by periodic updates may run for a significant amount of time on the chimera back-end. Therefore default update frequency is once a day:

```
	pnfsmanager.quota.update.interval=1
	(one-of?MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)pnfsmanager.quota.update.interval.time.unit = DAYS
```

The default has been chosen to match an installation having close to 1B chimera file entries. On smaller installations it is advisable to increase the frequency by decreasing the above interval value.

This means that quota enforcement is eventual. If users run out of allocated quota they still will be able to write data over quota until the next update happens. Likewise, removing over quota data will not be noticed by the quota system until the next update.

Internally the quota check involves holding two maps `<uid, Quota>` (user quota map) and `<gid, Quota>` (group quota map) in memory at the level of `JdbcFs`. When create entry function is called the uid, gid and Retention Policy (based on RetentionPolicy tag of the parent directory or default retention policy if there is no tag) are used to check if maps have necessary entries and exception is thrown if space counts  exceed limits. Both maps are refreshed in memory from DB back-end every minute to pick possible new entries and new limits as well as to eventually catch the updated space usage counts.

From above follows that quota system is not going to work well with explicit space reservations (or space reservations expressed as WriteToken tag) on dCache installations having both disk-only and tape-backed pools. It requires RetentionPolicy tag. Although, since a general practice is to not to mix files with different retention policies under the same directories, this could work if RetentionPolicy tag is added to the containing directories.

On tape-only or disk-only installations, where Retention Policy of files is
unambiguous, the quota can rely on default, system-wide Retention policy value. On tape-only system, the default value supplied with dCache distribution is good:
```
    (one-of?CUSTODIAL|REPLICA|OUTPUT)dcache.default-retention-policy=CUSTODIAL
```
On disk-only systems, it needs to be set to :
```
    dcache.default-retention-policy=REPLICA
```

On a mixed system, a `dcache.default-retention-policy=CUSTODIAL` can be utilized for files bound to tape and RetentionPolicy tag can be set in the root of the directrory tree where disk-only files are stored.

An admin user can interact with the quota system via the ```PnfsManager``` admin interface. For this, the following commands are provided:

```
	set group quota [OPTIONS] <gid>  # Set group quota
	set user quota [OPTIONS] <uid>  # Set user quota

	remove group quota <gid>  # remove group quota
	remove user quota <uid>  # remove user quota

	show group quota [-gid=<string>] [-h]  # Print group quota
	show user quota [-h] [-uid=<string>]  # Print user quota

```

Use ```help <command>``` to learn how to use the command.

A user-facing quota interface is implemented through RESTFul frontend (see above).

#### File system statistics

Added functionality to cache total files and total space used on DB backend. Added two properties that control how often heavy queries that calculates the total number of files and total used space in the namespace us ru

```
    pnfsmanager.fs-stat-cache.time = 3600
    pnfsmanager.fs-stat-cache.time.unit = SECONDS
```

The resulting numbers are typically seen when running `df` command.

This patch has shown to speed up NFS availablity (among other things) after startup, especially on large installations.

### Pool

Before dCache version 7.2, the scrubber process was starting with the pool startup. As a result, as long as a pool inventory is not complete, the scrubber will fail with `Operation not allowed while repository is in state LOADING`. With this version, the scrubber now will start only after the inventory is complete.

### Security (common)

A general change to the internal SSL handlers to enable, where possible, a pass-through to native SSL on the node (usually OpenSSL) rather than using the Java implementation has been made.  This change affects xrootd, https (webdav) and gsi (GridFTP).  It should give improved performance (up to about 20%) when data is being encrypted.

### SRM Manager

Optimally recalling data from tape is achieved by reducing the number of tape mounts and on-tape seeks by recalling as much volume as possible per mount. To that end a dedicated scheduling strategy exclusively for `bring-online` requests is introduced into the `SrmManager`. It is capable of clustering requests by tape according to a set of configurable criteria before passing them on to the rest of the system. In its current state it requires two files with information on targeted tapes, their capacity and occupancy as well as the mapping of tape-resident files to tape name. The file formats are described in the book.

The scheduler can be activated by adding the following line to the srmmanager section of the properties file:

```
srmmanager.plugins.enable-bring-online-clustering = true
```

and configured as described in the book.

It is important to note that the scheduler can only be effective when a dCache instance contains exactly one SrmManager.

### WebUI (dCacheView)

The admin view now includes a separate page for plots of file lifetimes by pool group.  All file lifetime plots have been simplified to a single data series (average lifetime).  The viewport on the pool plots page has also been adjusted for easier scrolling on smaller (laptop) screens.  The "print" button on the magnified plots dialog has been removed because it is not supported in all browsers.

For the new quota system, a quota view consisting of a read-only table has been added to the admin view.  A similar table (limited to the user's quotas) also appears in the UserProfile view.

### XRootD

Several important fixes have gone in since 7.1.

First, the parsing of the 'triedrc' CGI was incomplete; it now properly accounts for error code/message pairings.

Second, a race condition which was causing certain clients to report that a file is not found when requesting the checksum for an upload (persist on successful close) transfer was previously fixed in the door.  This fix has now been migrated to the pool (where it really belongs) and made more robust.

Finally, the third-party-copy client has been changed to conform with the behavior of the SLAC vanilla client so that it requests the exact number of remaining bytes on the final read chunk.  This should eliminate an issue previously encountered with a particular CEPH plugin.  The default chunk size has also been increased to 8 MiB to match the SLAC client.
