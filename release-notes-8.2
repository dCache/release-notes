## Release 8.2.33

### bulk

No more NPE/stack trace in the bulk `PIN` activity.

Online files should not accumulate useless user pins anymore.

### cli

No more false stack trace/bug output on the admin shell.

### gplazma

dCache will now accept non-targeted explicit AuthZ statements in the scope claim (e.g., storage.read). dCache will consider tokens containing compute explicit AuthZ statements but without any storage explicit AuthZ statements as tokens with explicit authorisation; the lack of any storage explicit authorisation statements will result in all requests with that token being denied.

dCache should continue to accept JWTs for longer, if there is a problem with the OP.

### pool

No more logged stack traces due to IllegalStateException: Attribute is not defined: SIZE errors.

## Release 8.2.31

### logback

Redundant replications of unused log files are removed and the qos activity is now recorded as well.

### qos

A bug was fixed that let to the message queue being blocked.

### webdav

This patch speeds up listing of directories through webdav.
All attributes are no longer supported/returned from PROPFIND, unless you set the following property on the WebDav door:

```
#  --- Default PROPFIND properties
#
#  The PROPFIND request allows a client to discover information
#  (properties) of dCache content.  When making a PROPFIND request,
#  the client normally indicates which properties are of interest.  If
#  not specified then the WebDAV server (dCache) is free to return a
#  default set of information.
#
#  Certain clients make PROPFIND requests without specifying
#  the desired set of properties, triggering a default set of
#  properties.  There are two problems with this: first, the
#  clients may react badly if information is missing from this default;
#  second, some of the required properties may have an adverse
#  performance impact for dCache.
#
#  This property controls whether to support client-side requests for
#  properties beyond a minimal set or not.
#
#      PERFORMANCE -- always return only a minimal set of information that does
#                     not incur any additional overhead. (These are basically
#                     the same as what a POSIX list request would proviode).
#
#      CLIENT_COMPATIBLE -- return the set of information required by
#                     the clients.  If the client does not specify the properties,
#                     it will get a maximal default set.
#
#  Because the performance impact of the latter under the most common usage scenarios
#  could be considerable, the default is set to PERFORMANCE.
#
(one-of?PERFORMANCE|CLIENT_COMPATIBLE)webdav.default-propfind-properties = PERFORMANCE
```

## Release 8.2.30

### bulk

Each time a bulk request is started, the container is given a new semaphore based on the number of permits defined for the activity in question.
This patch sets the default per-container permit values to something more reasonable.

## Release 8.2.25

### bulk

`RuntimeException`s should not cause the `request ls` to fail globally.

### other

Update our citations file.

### pnfs

A modest speed-up of directory listing by not always
resolving symlinks when checking restrictions.

### qos

Two small incompatibilities with subject and attributes are fixed.

Improvements in triggering QoS operation queues, which reduces the
potential for queue starvation.

## Release 8.2.23

### bulk

Now REST API (Frontend) distinguishes `Not Found` from `Invalid` request.

### dcache

netty library has been updated to 4.1.92 with minor bugfix release.

### metadata

No user- or admin observable changes.

### pnfsmanager

Multiple batch jobs executing listings of the same directories especially if directories contain many entries quickly exhaust active threads, 
each thread executing the same listing, denying listing to all other customers and creating significant load on namespace server (and DB).
 Clients time out and retry creating even more load on dCache.

This is now fixed and lists of large directories no longer hog PnfsManage denying service to all other list calls. 
Additionally observed significnat reduction of CPU and IO load on chimera DB host. 

### webdav

The current release fixed visual element regression after bootstrap 5 upgrade

## Release 8.2.22

### bulk

Increase the database column `path` to 1024 chars, so ATLAS and others will
not experience failures because paths are too long.

### dcache

Symlinks on both constraints and targets are permitted; thus macaroons
will also work.

### gplazma

If there is a login failure involving a OIDC JWT then potentially
important information is now extracted from the JWT and included
in the logged login failure report.

POSC works with tokens when user root is '/'.

### kafka

Change the LoggingProducerListener so that when a TimeoutException is
caught, the error message will indicate that there is a connection
issue or the broker is down.

### nfs

When on LAYOUTGET door returned an error back to the client, then,
as the operation failed, the client will not issue LAYOUT_RETURN.
Thus such transfers would stay in the door. This is now fixed.

## Release 8.2.17

### bulk

No more uncaught JSON object key not found exception.

### dcache

Application of restrictions is correct in that the ownership
and scope of the resolved link is examined.

### frontend

Add description to Stage, but also to the generic Bulk request
TAPE REST API in the swagger page.

### gplazma

It is now possible to configure dCache so the oidc plugin does not check
audience fields.  This should be used where necessary and only for a
short transition period.

An OP declaration now supports the `-suppress=offline` argument to force
dCache to query the userinfo endpoint, even if the access token is a
JWT.  A warning is logged on startup if offline verification is
suppressed.

### pom

Update stable branches to include bug fix to the TPC client behavior
so that it establishes a secure connection to its source when the source TLS
setting is STRICT.

creation; stack trace is replaced by a logging statement.

### gplazma

For xrootd "persist on successful close" (POSC), authorization is
successful for both x509 and OIDC/Scitokens.

### history

The history service should no longer generate the reported
NaN stack trace in the histogram pipeline.

## Release 8.2.12

### chimera

There should be less load on the trash table database of the cleaner and thus higher performance.


### dcache-xroot

With `xrootd.authz.anonymous-operations=READONLY`, anonymous login allows world-readable files to
be read; with `xrootd.authz.anonymous-operations=NONE`, it does not allow anonymous operations. This is
for two-party interactions. Third-party copy
with OIDC tokens will work regardless of the
value given to this property.

### dcap

Update dcap door to always start mover in a passive mode.

## Release 8.2.10

### bulk

Links are handled as they should be when they are refetched from prestored targets and
the requests complete.

Expanded directories are now marked as SKIPPED if activity does not apply 
to directories.

### chimera

When receiving a reply from a pool it is no longer waiting for, cleaner-hsm will not send a new delete request 
or forget the currently-waited-on pool anymore. Logging is added to inform when cleaner-hsm receives 
a reply from a pool it is no longer waiting for, indicating that the timeout might be too small.

### pool

Updated host certificate is available to https mover. Fixed p2p transfers over HTTPS.

### skel

Add the necessary deprecations to
bulk.properties and qos.properties.

### xroot

There should be no longer exceptions reporting no exception handler to handle
the exception.

the direct-memory consumption of the xroot proxy door.

Add information on domain naming and uniqueness.

### dcache-frontend, webdav

A `.well-known/security.txt` (see https://securitytxt.org/) is now

## Release 8.2.7

### bulk

Version 2 of the Bulk service was not properly supporting the expectation that the target
paths of a submitted request be immediately visible to the user who issues a GET on the
request. This has now been rectified by storing them in the dedicated database table at
arrival rather than when the request begins to run.

### chimera

A bug was fixed that threw a NullPointerException when the associated hsms for a pool are stored as `null`.

### pool

A bug was fixed that falsely triggered idle connection handler on zero-copy transfers.

### xroot

The default plugins were reordered to conform to ZTN-first.

Proxying through the door has been fixed so that the IP version used by the proxy client
matches what is available on the pools. Before this, proxying through a dual stack door
to pools which were IPv4 only was failing. Note also that billing now reflects the door
IP as the client of the billing transfer, but maintains the originating IP as the client
of the door transaction.

Update xrootd4j to support kXR_prefname in kXR_locate request.

## Release 8.2.6

### bulk

The bulk service now only locks at the beginning until the namespace has been successfully pinged.
All reloading of previous tasks takes place under the covers. Note that the manager still starts
only after the reloading activity has completed. Incoming requests will of course be deprioritized
as their timestamps are posterior to the reloaded requests.

A bug was fixed that prevented an update of counts reported by info().

Improvements were made to significantly speed-up retrieval of target rows if the table grows to more than 100M.

### bulk,frontend

A bug was fixed that prevented cancel on a QUEUED request to move the request from CANCELLING to CANCELLED state.
If a BulkRequest contains an empty target list it will now complete and return a 400 BadRequest.

### chimera

Cleaner cells that do not have leadership will now more strictly enforce not triggering delete runs.

### frontend

Bulk resource target now supports both string and array/list definitions.

### nfs-proxy

Proxy-IO with posix locks now works as expected.

### xroot

xrdcp --cksum now works again.

## Release 8.2.5

### bulk

The  garbled request policy command output is fixed now


There was a wrong option for target type (REGULAR, not FILE).
This is now fixed and admin commands are now consistent.

### nearline-storage

A NPE on error path has been fixed.

The  race condition  when  flushing removed file is fixed now.

### poolmanager

Motivation:
When a new entry is added to the RequestContainer the file pnfsid and netunit is used as an unique identity. However, despite the fact that
two different units are a members of the same unit group, we might get
two requests created, thus two stages are triggered. For instance:

`0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 & ::/0 => world-net`

`00007BBC36AB359E47A383A75CFA2AB6CDEF@0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0-/ m=1 r=1339 [pool_A] [Waiting for stage: pool_A 10.05 16:41:55] {0,}`
`00007BBC36AB359E47A383A75CFA2AB6CDEF@::/0 m=1 r=1339 [pool_B] [Waiting for stage: pool_B 10.05 16:43:23] {0,}`

now it should work with:

`00007BBC36AB359E47A383A75CFA2AB6CDEF@world-net-/ m=1 r=1339 [pool_A] [Waiting for stage: pool_A 10.05 17:11:37] {0,}`

## Release 8.2.3

### bulk

The command `\s bulk request submit -activity=STAGE` now overrides the -prestore
option to true. This makes it consistent with the RESTful API.

Cancellation of PIN requests via bulk module which were not
marked with -prestore=true no longer fail to complete.

### chimera

Pools that are no longer actively being cleaned were previously falsely
still listed as active in the admin interface when the cleaning attempt
ended due to an exception. This has been fixed.

### core

If a pin is unpinned while a pin request for that same pin is still
ongoing in pinmanager, pinning will not be retried.

### pnfsmanager

On massive uploads (create entries) to a single directory we observed
performance degradation leading to all available threads being busy,
denying other users from accessing the namespace. This has been alleviated.

### pool

The performance of downloading over plain http is increased by using zero-copy mode.

Less CPU load on pools in case of client accessing a file with
invalid/expired state id.

### xroot

A warning was added to the documentation about the default TLS option,
which changed. `OFF` is the only option for TLS which does not
require the presence of the host cert/key.

## Release 8.2.1

### Changes affecting multiple services

The commands psu match and psux match can now be used with pnfsid or path.

### core

ac_psu(x)_match commands has been improved to handle null/globbed values correctly in psu match.

### frontend

It is now possible to filter and sort the results of the RESTful API call GET /restores by path, owner and group.

NOTE: This resource is protected by the frontend.authz.unlimited-operation-visibility property, which means that
proprietary information can be optionally protected by limiting it to those with admin privileges.

### gplazma2-grid

An empty requires field in IGTF policy is now accepted. Files with invalid or unexpected policies are ignored.

### webdav

A bug was fixed that caused a NullPointerException while sending Kafka messages.

jquery was updated to version 3.6.1 and bootstrap was updated to version 5.2.1

### xroot

The proxy is now bind to a local address that respects the network of the client and is likely reachable by it.

## Release 8.2.0


### Bulk

The bulk service has undergone a major revision.  There have
been numerous internal changes and enhancements, but the most
important have to do with persistence and scalability.

The bulk service now requires a database which holds
request information (instead of raw files, as in version 1).
Bulk requests are serviced concurrently, but each request
runs in its own container in order to optimize threading
and I/O.  

The UPDATE_QOS activity communicates with (and thus requires
the presence of) the new QoS Engine, but the other bulk
activities can be run without QoS being present.  

Aside from being accessed through frontend REST APIs,
the bulk service has a full set of admin shell commands
which are useful for spot-checking its operational state
and the status of requests (along with their individual targets).

A fuller explanation is available in The Book
chapter on the bulk service.


### Cleaner

An admin command was added to the `cleaner` cell that allows forgetting a pool, meaning removing any corresponding delete target entries from the cleaner's trash table database. If the requested pool is not currently blacklisted, the admin is required to explicitly enforce the operation.



### Frontend

For the bulk-requests API:  the typing of primitive parameters in the JSON
bulk request has been loosened so that booleans and numerics can also be 
specified as strings. 

The RESTful options for QoS (for instance, in api/v1/namespace) as of 
version 8.1 communicate with the new QoS Engine.

The JSON returned from GET api/v1/bulk-requests is no longer a
simple array of URLs, but an array of objects with fuller info 
concerning each request (hence this return value now requires 
parsing; see the SWAGGER page for fuller information).  All matching
requests are now returned (rather than those owned only by the user), 
though it is possible to filter the result by a comma-delimited list 
of user/owner ids.

A new TAPE API has been made available for the purposes of
bulk staging (api/v1/tape); it implements the WLCG TAPE specification,
and thus includes api/v1/tape/archiveinfo [=locality for dCache], 
api/v1/tape/stage and api/v1/tape/release [=unpin for dCache].  
See the SWAGGER pages for fuller info.  There is also a section 
in the User Guide (Frontend/BulkRequests) which details the APIs 
for bulk-requests and tape along with their differences.



### PNFS Manager

Historically, the dCache namespace was allowing hard links on directories. This violates
POSIX restrictions and is a source of file system cyclic loops. With dCache release 8.2
creation of hard links on directories is not allowed any more. The existing hard links will
work as before; however, it is recommended to replace them with soft links.

To allow pool, nearline storage and other components to make scheduling decisions based on
file creation time, PnfsManager will include the CREATION_TIME attribute whenever STORAGEINFO 
is requested.

### Pool

Added `rm kill` command that canceles a pending file remove request from HSM.

When a pool decides which storage class to flush it uses the last submission time. However, submission
time is re-set when a pool fails to flush the file and re-submit the file. Starting with 8.2, 
a pool will sort the flushing based on the time when files are created on the pool.

### Poolmanager

PoolManager has been updated to support pool groups that contain other pool groups. For example:

```
psu create pgroup -dynamic -tags=hw-class=IO io-pools
psu create pgroup -dynamic -tags=hw-class=replica replica-pools
psu create pgroup all-pools
psu addto pgroup all-pools @io-pools @replica-pools
```

The values prefixed by `@` in the `psu addto pgroup` command are treated as groups.


### Resilience / QoS Engine

The fully refactored QoS Engine first became available in 8.1.  Among
other things, its components are intended to replace Resilience.   While
Resilience is still available in 8.2, it will eventually be deprecated, so it
is advisable to begin switching to QoS with this Golden Release.  

There is a chapter on the QoS service components in The Book, which includes
instructions on how to set it up to emulate Resilience (the differences are minor).

Note that a major change between Resilience and QoS is that the QoS Verifier
uses a database whereas none was used by Resilience.




### XRootD

Several improvements have been made so that the door endpoint address is consistently reported.

An important oversight in the door code has been corrected.  A client disconnect now also
interrupts any thread waiting on a response from PoolManager; otherwise, all available threads
could be tied up, potentially blocking further client connections.

The xroot door is now capable of running in "proxy" mode; when this switch is turned on,
the client connects through the door instead of directly to the pool in order to read or write data 
(allowing for outside communication with pools protected on an internal network, for instance).  An
internal address (subnet) can also be given which will be used for the Pool Manager pool selection.
Details are available in the xroot chaper of The Book.

### Zookeeper

The Zookeeper version has been updated to the latest stable release 5.7.1
