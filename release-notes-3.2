## Release 3.2.0

### Authentication

We've added support for macaroons in the webdav door.

Macaroons are a new idea that comes from research by Google.  They are
bearer tokens that allows the bearer to do something, without
requiring that the user identifying who they are.

A macaroon may be limited and only allow the bearer to do certain
things by having caveats.  Caveats could by any limitation.  A caveat
could make the macaroon time-limited (e.g, only good for five
minutes), location-limited (e.g., only from a particular IP address),
or anything else.  You can learn more about macaroons from this video:

https://air.mozilla.org/macaroons-cookies-with-contextual-caveats-for-decentralized-authorization-in-the-cloud/

Macaroons are a building-block technology, so have many potential
uses.  They may be used by a web-portal to allow its clients (of which
dCache knows nothing) direct access to files stored in dCache.  They
may be used to authorise third-party transfers without requiring X.509
credential delegation.  They may be used to create a link that allows
sharing of resources. There are likely many other uses for them.

Requesting a macaroon is as simple as making a POST request with a
Content-Type of `application/macaroon-request`.  This returns a
time-limited (but otherwise unlimited) macaroon.  Additional caveats
may be added by dCache (include them as JSON in the POST request) or
subsequently by anyone else.  dCache supports a rich set of possible
restrictions, including namespace (e.g., only a particular file or
directory), time (e.g., only the next 5 minutes), location (e.g., only
from a particular IP address or subnet), and activity (e.g., only
downloads).

Creating a macaroon takes very little CPU and no storage in dCache.
Therefore it is safe to request many macaroons; for example, a web
portal could create a seperate macaroon for every file its user wishes
to view.

A macaroon is a bearer token.  To use a macaroon in an HTTP request,
just add it in the Authorization header value with a prefix `bearer`,
just like with an OpenID-Connect access-token.

Unfortunately not all HTTP clients allow a user to add a bearer token
to the Authorization HTTP header; for example, a user cannot easily
include a bearer token in their web-browser.  To support these
clients, dCache supports URLs that include the 'authz' query
parameter, with the value used as a bearer token (e.g.,
`https://dcache.example.org/path/to/file?authz=<token>`).  This works
for both OpenID-Connect access-token or macaroon.

The webdav directory browsing has been updated so that any query
parameters in the original request are included in all the generated
page's navigation and download links.  This makes it easy to navigate
through the webdav interface using a macaroon or OpenID-Connect
access-token: just add `?authz=<token>` to the URL.

### Roles

It may be desirable for dCache to behave differently for the same user
between different login session.  For example, an administrative user
may wish sometimes to interact with dCache as a normal user (for
testing purposes or to reduce the risk of mistakes), and other times to
interact with dCache with effectively root-like prividges.


This functionality has been enabled by introducing a concept of user
roles in dCache. A user may log in requesting zero or
more roles and the login process chooses which roles (if any) to enact.

For the HTTP-based services (webdav and restful), the roles can be
chosen by appending '#' and a comma-separated list of roles to
their username; for example, user 'fred' wishing to adopt 'role-a' and
'role-b' roles would authenticate with the username
'fred#role-a,role-b'.

This release introduces limited support for the 'admin' role.

The 'admin' role is intended to give users root-like permissions without
the user knowing root credential and with the user's
identity still being bound to that user.  The result is that the user
with 'admin' role is able to do everything, but files created by that
user are still owned by that user and log entries show which user
enacted changes.

An 'admin' role user has a root directory of `/` and no restrictions.

The functionality is enabled by adding new gPlazma session plugin 'roles' to
`gplazma.conf` file like so:

```
session  required    roles
```

A new property
```
gplazma.roles.admin-gid = 0
```
has been added to `gplazma.properties`. A user must be a member of the above specified
group to be authorized to obtain the admin role.

### Admin improvements

The `ps` command of the System cell has been overhauled. In particular
the output of the `-f` option has been cleaned up and extended.

The admin cell now generates access log events containing connection,
disconnection as well as authentication events.

Key based authentication has been improved by enforcing that a
particular key can only log in with the user name specified in the
`authorized_keys2` file. Upon upgrade, admins should review this file
and ensure that keys are mapped to the correct user name.


### Namespace

Tags are now reference counted like any other filesystem object. This
avoids an expensive database query upon file deletion that in some
cases has led to bottlenecks, in particular when PostgreSQL statistics
were inaccurate. Upon upgrade the reference count for existing tags
has to be populated which may take a little while on large databases.


### Checksum handling

Two improvements have been made.  The first has to do with what happens when a
client provides a checksum.  In this case, dCache now verifies and stores the
provided checksum as well as computes and stores the checksum of the type
configured by the admin in the pool setup.

The second has to do with interoperability between clients requesting
different checksum types (this mainly derives from the Globus MD5 requirement).
The FTP door has been modified to compute a missing checksum required by
the client on the fly.  This way, files written by a protocol requiring ADLER32
can be read by clients requiring MD5, and vice-versa.  This fix requires
updating only the FTP door.

Finally, an admin command

```
    get file checksums <pnfsid>
```

has been added to PnfsManager to display multiple checksums.


### RESTful api

With this release, information that has traditionally been made available via
the legacy httpd and webadmin pages will also be accessible via REST apis.

A full description of the paths and parameters for each RESTful service, along
with example JSON output, will soon be published on the dCache GitHub Wiki.

Included in this release are the apis and supporting services for alarms,
billing, cell info, pool and pool group info, active transfers and
tape restores/stages.

An illustrative example:

```
    curl -k -u arossi#admin:xxxxx 'https://fndcatemp1.fnal.gov:3880/api/v1/pools/dmsdca22-7?info=true'
```

The request is for the basic information concerning a pool; the JSON object
returned includes cell information, pool configuration/setup information,
pool cost and request statistics, space statistics, sweeper statistics, etc.
There are additional parameters for requesting histogram data on pool requests,
space usage, and file lifetime on the pool.

Notice the user name in the curl command. Use of these services requires admin
privileges. Here, it is presumed that the user has been accorded the admin role;
the '#' after the login name indicates a request to express that role for this
session.  See the section on Roles above for a fuller explanation.

In addition to the new admin services, a small bug has been fixed in the
handling of QoS updates on the namespace service, so that the request correctly
considers the current locality of the file.


### Frontend and WebDAV - MARINA/FEMI

Version 3 X.509 certificates support the Subject Alternative Name
extension. This extention allows the certificate to include information
about the user in additional to the user's DN, such as the user's email
address. dCache 3.2 updated x509 plugin to extract email addresses from 
Subject Alternative Name and add this to the list of principals identifying the user.

Frontend clients can now discover a user's email addresses, if any are known.

They can upload files and directories as well as move file(s) using drag and drop.

Users with `non-/ root` directory will see the same files and directories
under WebDAV as with other protocols.

Frontend provides information consistent with other protocols for users
with a non-/ root.

Frontend 'mkdir' and 'mv' operations are updated to honour door and user
roots.

### Obsolete services

dCache 2.16 introduced the next generation replication service called
the resilience manager. At the time we announced that the replica
manager would eventually be removed. We try to keep what we promise,
so now the old service is gone. If you haven't migrated yet, you
should do so before upgrading to dCache 3.2.


### systemd support on Debian based systems

Traditionally we have shipped out own scripts to daemonize
dCache. This made it easier support many different distributions and
to support the multi process architecture of dCache (in other words,
it was more fun to implement our own than to study how each
distribution did it). For better or worse the mainstream Linux
distributions all moved to systemd and it becomes hard to justify why
dCache shouldn't make use of the functionality offered.

As a first step towards systemd, this release recognizes systemd on
Debian based systems. If detected during installation, part of the
dCache runtime management scripts are replaced by callouts to
systemd. A systemd generator scans the dCache configuration and
creates a systemd unit for every dCache domain. systemd fully and
directly manages each dCache process. This means:

- No custom wrapper scripts; there is now only one process per dCache domain.

- systemd monitors the Java process and restarts it if it quits directly. There is no
  separate 'restart file' to suppress the dCache auto-restart mechanism.

- No PID files as systemd tracks the dCache processes directly.

- systemd captures the stdout/stderr output of the process and directs
  it to journald. The default journald setup passes the log on to
  syslog.

- systemd drops privileges of the Java process during startup. systemd mounts
  `/etc`, `/usr`, `/boot`, and `/home` read-only for dCache process, preventing dCache
  from writing to any of these directories. *Note*: This is important to
  remember if you happen to use `/home` for pool data or tape integration.

#### Starting and stopping dCache domains

Whenever the list of dCache domains changes, the dCache units need to
be regenerated. dCache will do this automatically whenever its
`dcache` script is invoked as root, but one may also do this manually
by running `systemctl daemon-reload`. This also fixes a long standing
issue with dCache loosing track of running domains that are removed
from its configuration.

The `dcache` script has been updated to call out to `systemctl` to
start and stop domains. One can continue to use these commands to
manually start and stop domains. Since the systemd support replaces
the classic SysV init script, auto-startup during boot has changed:
The generated systemd units are not flagged as enabled
automatically: Although one can start and stop these domains, they do
not start automatically. Use the `systemd enable` command on every
domain that should start automatically. In contrast to before, one can
select exactly which domains should start automatically.

#### Logging

Since dCache by default logs to stdout and since systemd redirects
stdout to journald and thus to syslog, dCache logs now end up in
syslog. An rsyslog configuration is included to seperate the dCache
log output from other syslog messages. Each domain logs to
`/var/log/dcache@DOMAIN.log` where DOMAIN is the dCache domain. The
file cannot be placed in `/var/log/dcache` due to permission
requirements enforced by rsyslog. The default logrotate setup is
adjusted to rotate the new files. It is no longer necessary to use the
`copytruncate` option, which makes logrotation more efficient, use
less disk space, and avoids the risk of loosing log entries.

Since syslog includes timestamps automatically, the default log format
is modified upon upgrade to not include the timestamp in the dCache
output. If the log format was customized, it must be adjusted. Since
the log format changes anyway, we also adjusted how the NDC is
logged.

If you really liked the old log format and placement, you may
reconfigure the logging in `/etc/dcache/logback.xml` to log directly
to `/var/log/dcache` rather than stdout. If you do, you should ideally
use the logback logrotation rather than rely on logrotated.



#### RedHat

Nobody has bothered upgrade the RedHat packaging with systemd support
yet. Volunteers are welcome.


### FTP

The FTP door was updated to allow pipelining of commands. Since the
FTP protocol expects some commands to have immediate effect - ie
before the previous commands have finished - this is not as trivial as
it sounds. We believe we have nailed it, both fixing bugs in the
existing implementation and avoiding the bugs other services have in
their attempt to support pipelining.

The immediate effect is better compatibility with Globus Online.

### WebDAV - FEMI

- [http: fix non-/ root for WebDAV and frontend doors](http://github.com/dcache/dcache/commit/0bc04f6b7127ba135bcda0f3ffac37de49299cad)

### Space usage

Continuing the WLCG quest to reimplement the features of SRM in other
protocols, dCache now exposes space reservation stats through both FTP
and WebDAV.

For FTP the `SITE USAGE` command is implemented, supplying information
from SpaceManager using reservations with a description that matches
the TOKEN argument (if a TOKEN was given) or that are bound to the
supplied path (if TOKEN was omitted).

For WebDAV, reservations are exposed as RFC 4331 quoatas and can be
queried as such.

### NFS - TIGRAN

Update handling of directory listings. This should avoid situations, when client was receiven BAD_COOKIE
error, cased by server-side cache invalidation. The stage and p2p operations are handles the same way and
more client friendly. 'show transfer' admin command supports filtering based on client ip, pnfs id and pool
name.

### Xrootd

Xrootdfs FUSE driver immediately closes a file on creation,
then reopens it to write. The behavior of xrootd door in dCache
has been modified to allow to overwrite new empty files enabling
xrootdfs FUSE file copies into dCache mounted filesystem.


### Pools - TIGRAN
Pools can use mongoDB to store metadata. This can be enabled by:
```
pool.plugins.meta=org.dcache.pool.repository.meta.mongo.MongoDbMetadataRepository
```
configuration option. Additional properties control mongoDB server location, database name and
collecton name:
```
pool.plugins.meta.mongo.url=mongodb://localhost:27017    
pool.plugins.meta.mongo.db=pdm
pool.plugins.meta.mongo.collection=poolMetadata
```
A single shared mongoDB instance can be used for all pools. NOTICE, in production mongodb must
run in a custer to provide high performance and availability.

- [pool: add support for mongodb as a backend for medatada](http://github.com/dcache/dcache/commit/130e160f5ce78e29c3ed8ea73b4aefd59004c73e)
