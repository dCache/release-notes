## Release 3.1.16

### nfs

The nfs doors did not shut down cleanly. This slowed down the shutdown sequence. 
This is now fixed and dCache shutdown is faster and less likely to suffer problems.

### pool

The current release fixed regression in GridFTP OPTS CKSM command  and   GridFTP `OPTS CKSM` command is supported again.

The current release fixe  regression with third-party pull transfers using GridFTP, with
dCache acting as the GridFTP client that prevented data integrity
checks.

### resilience

When resilience tries to copy or remove a file, and it is no longer
in the namespace, this should be a fatal error, differently from
the discovery that a replica is no longer in cache. These two
errors, however, were  treated the same way. This is now fixed and the correct behavior is 
immediate abort of operation when file is not in namespace.

The current release improved error handling for file deletion during scan correctly it fixed bug in formatting and handling of cache exception types.


When doing a pool scan, the storage unit information must be
recovered for each file. This is done from the chimera attributes.
The code checks an internal map for an index number corresponding
to the unit it knows about from the PoolMonitor.

However, if the pool selection unit configuration changes such that
a storage unit is eliminated, that mapping will also be deleted
from resilience. In the case that the attributes stored in
Chimera still have the older storage class information, there
will be a NoSuchElementException thrown.

This is fixed now and Pool scans that encounter this situation do not get stuck
forever in the queue.

### webdav

In RFC 7230, section 3.2, it states that HTTP header names should be
case insensitive. Despite this, the standard milton mechanism for
acquiring header information is case sensitive, which (in turn) means
that several HTTP header values in dCache are similarly case sensitive.
There were reports that this case sensitivity has caused problems with certain clients (e.g., go).
The current release fixed this issue and headers that control third-party transfers are now case insensitive, so should work with more clients.

## Release 3.1.15

### cells

The current release improved handling of rogue domains with badly formatted dCache versions.


### configuration

There are configuration options in zookeeper that may affect how well
the zookeeper cluster will work with dCache. The lack of documentation
of how dCache uses zookeeper prevents admins from tuning their zookeeper
instance. This is now fixed and zookeeper configuration is updated with
 hints on how dCache uses zookeeper, along with the corresponding zookeeper configuration properties.

### pool

The current release fixed loading `setup` that requires queues created by `pool.queues`.

### webdav

The current release fixed the stack-traces on bad client input.

## Release 3.1.14

### admin

While `migration move` tasks on pools were working correctly, for `migration info` command an error occurred,
 that the current user (root) wasn't allowed to execute anything (due to missing ACLs). This is now fixed.

### pool

The current release fixed  fix regression in HTTP third-party transfer with redirection and 
third-party transfers work again when uploading to services that redirect-on-PUT (such as dCache, if so configured).

### webdav

The current release several regressions with `CredentialSource.NONE`. 

The current release fixed  regression in third-party copy with no delegation.

## Release 3.1.13

### configuration

For some services it was unclear what were the admin's responsibilities in
terms of consistent configuration. The current release updated the documentation describing what is needed to deploy redundant services.

### resilience

The current relase improved configuration for namespace provider properties by making them immutable.

### srm

The current release improved configuration  for  `srmPing` responses.

## Release 3.1.12

### billing

The current release added documentation that describes how a `CellAddress` and its fields
expand.

### config

The current release improves documentation for dCache admins by adding `obsolete|forbidden` annotation for dropped properties.
This helps admins to discover changes that might affect their dCache
instance. This is both through manual inspection and through the
`dcache check-config` command.

### ftp

It has been discovered that timestamp facts reported by dCache
GFTP server are expressed in local (to server) time. 
This is now fixed. Timestamp facts are reported in GMT.
 Clients like `globus-url-copty -sync`
work properly and ` ubefrtp -ls` returns correct timestamp.

### srm

The current release added new configuration properties to allow easy modification.

It  upstated  as well `srm/manager.properties`  documentation to describe the relationship between `srmmanager.root` and `srm.loginbroker.root`  properties.

:   pnfsmanager: remove obsolete comments from properties file

## Release 3.1.11

### Changes affecting multiple services

Christoph Anton Mitterer submitted several corrections to the comment string in properties files.

### srm

The '-version' command-line option previously only returned information about which SRM
specification version is supported, but not the srmclient version. This patch changes the
srmclient version information string to include both client version and SRM compatibility.

### zookeeper

A race condition in zookeeper caused irrelevant stacktraces to be logged on shutdowns.
Since this problem is not easily solvable with Zookeeper 3.4, we decided to change the log-level
threshold for NIOServerCnxnFactory. Note that the suppressed class is only used by ZooKeeper server (i.e.,
not the client). Therefore, only the 'zookeeper' service is affected.

`admin.ssh.idle-timeout` and `admin.ssh.idle-timeout.unit`.

### httpd

The "Disk Space Usage" webpage (`/usageInfo`) contains a table showing
information about each pool in the dCache cluster.  The "Layout"
column showed the capacity usage graphically, with different colours
showing how much of that pool's capacity is being used for different
tasks.  This release fixes the Layout heading to describe a previously
undocumented colour.

## Release 3.1.8

### Changes affecting multiple services

dCache previously shipped both log4j and log4j-over-slf4j libraries. This patch simplifies deployment and prevents possible problems due to non-deterministic
library loading sequences by removing log4j dependencies.

### frontend

If frontend was asked to create a directory listing while a file was being uploaded into the directory being listed, 
previously, an error would occur. This patch addresses that issue.

This release includes a new dCacheView version.

### info

The info cell can occasionally send messages before it is properly registered. This can lead to `Cannot send message with callback in state...` messages that 
do not correspond to any valid error condition. This patch ensures that messages are only sent as soon as the cell is properly registered.

### pool

If the communication between a pool and PnfsManager times out, the error message is not well suited to diagnosing the problem: 
`Failed to instantiate mover due to unsupported checksum type: Request to [>PnfsManager@local] timed out.` The checksum type is 
not playing an important role here. Hence, this patch updates the error message.

### zookeeper

Embedded Zookeeper instances would occasionally log stack-traces on startup. This patch adds a work-around.

Zookeeper logs a stack-trace in cases where the client disconnects unexpectedly. This is unnecessary and potentially confusing, so this patch changes 
Zookeeper's behaviour to just logging the incident.

## Release 3.1.7

### frontend

Clients can now send a `Suppress-WWW-Authenticate` header in order to avoid the native login dialog in browsers.

### hsm

A potential space leak in staging requests has been mitigated.

### pool

Since there are various reasons for why a mover may be terminated, the previous log message "Transfer was
forcefully killed" is not detailed enough to deduce the reason behind the problem. This patch enables more
detailed error messages both in the log files and in billing. Note, however, that the door's report of the failed 
transfer may duplicate this information.

### webdav

A recent update, commit 5abc0e1c, improved the behaviour of the Milton WebDAV libraries if an IOException occurs
during an upload. That patch, unfortunately, did not address all issues, and when non-spec-conformant clients
are used against dCache, stacktraces can be triggered.

This patch corrects that behaviour. Also, in case of errors, the error code returned in case of any problems
was changed from 400 to 500, which should signal cliens that they are free to retry the transfer after a timeout.

In case of failing transfers, doors will log more accurate information.

## Release 3.1.6

### http

In an HA setup with multiple pool managers, the httpd (old) service failed to
fetch the list of restore requests from all instances. Instead the service
would query one of the instances, possibly alternating depending on the
grouping of services in domains. This behaviour has been corrected, so that
the http interface now shows all restored entries even in HA configurations.

### webdav

File transfers through WebDAV doors could potentially bypass any Restrictions
checks in PnfsManager. This patch ensures that Restrictions are always checked
and observed, and improves PnfsManager's logging to give information in case
a Restrictions check is not posssible.

## Release 3.1.5

### frontend

OpenID connect can now be enabled from dCacheView. This change introduces three new 
properties in the `frontend.properties` file, 
`frontend.dcache-view.oidc-provider-name-list`, 
`frontend.dcache-view.oidc-client-id-list` and 
`frontend.dcache-view.oidc-authz-endpoint-list`, 
all of which are documented in the properties file.

### pinmanager

Upgrades from dCache 2.13 could occasionally fail during the Liquibase update stage. 
The database table `pinsv3` can not be dropped if it is still referenced by foreign
keys of other tables. This modification adds a `cascadeConstraints=true` modifier to 
the dropTable command used during the conversion process. Thereby, updates are possible
without errors and PinManager starts without issues after an upgrade.

### rest-api

Requests to /api/v1/user now include the username of the requestor. This is intended 
to make working with OpenID Connect tokens easier.

## Release 3.1.2

### chimera

In order to improve IO performance, the way dCache updates `atime` values was modified.

### nfs

An internal change in the NFS door code helps reducing irrelevant exceptions being logged.

### srm

SRM no longer times out file requests. 
This alleviates a rare race condition where timeouts for the file request and file access competed. 
Requests that time out now always return SRM_REQUEST_TIMED_OUT at request
level and SRM_FAILURE for the SURLs in that request.

## Release 3.1.0

#### Chimera CLI can query access latency and retention policy

If you ever needed to query the access latency or retention policy of
a file you will be delighted to learn the the Chimera shell now
supports doing just that.

To support this, some configuration properties have been added.

Previously, the `chimera` shell reused the `pnfsmanager` properties.
With dCache v3.1, the `chimera` shell has its own set of properties.
See the `/usr/share/dcache/defaults/chimerashell.properties` file for
the details.

In addition, the configuration properties
`dcache.default-access-latency` and `dcache.default-retention-policy`
have been added.  These new properties are the default values for
`chimerashell.default-access-latency` &
`chimerashell.default-retention-policy` (respectively), and
`pnfsmanager.default-access-latency` &
`pnfsmanager.default-retention-policy` (respectively).

If you have configured `pnfsmanager.default-access-latency` or
`pnfsmanager.default-retention-policy` then dCache will continue to
work as before; however, the `chimera` shell may show incorrect
information when querying access-latency or retention-policy
information of a directory.

To fix this, you should update your configuration so that
`dcache.default-access-latency` and `dcache.default-retention-policy`
are adjusted instead.  These `dcache.` properties should be configured
on all nodes where you host a pnfsmanager service or intend to run the
`chimera` client.


#### Fail fast on lack of stage permission

If you rely on the pool manager stage protection feature, know that
you are a rare breed. We have not forgotten about you though and fixed
a problem that would cause staging to be retried and fail repeatedly
has been fixed. A user who lacks permission to stage a file is now
told so right away.


#### Allow regular expression matching of storage units in resilience manager

Pool manager allows matching storage unit names by regular
expressions. Resilience manager failed to mirror this feature in
previous versions. Expect this to no longer be the case. As the
developer put it: Resilience also supports what PoolManager supports.


#### Drop support for regular expression matching in alarms

Since we needed regular expression matching in resilience, we had to
remove it from alarms...

Just kidding. We removed it because it limited scalability and greatly
complicated the code and a poll among users showed nobody used
it. Alarms can now be defined at any logging level without risk of
denial of service on the server.  In order to guarantee such alarms be
sent, the remote logging property should be set to an adequately low
level.  Currently this would be WARN.



#### Storage URIs can be set through NFS dot commands

A dot command, `.(suri)(<file>)`, has been added to NFS by which one
can store, retrieve and modify the URI string(s).


#### Chimera now tracks file state

Traditionally it was difficult to distinguish a file that is still
being uploaded from one for which upload has completed. Chimera now
holds this state information, which improves the reliability of
detecting this state and reduces load on the database. The change is
backwards compatible and does not require schema changes.

#### RESTful improvements

Now it is even easier to get rid of your files thanks to a new
RESTful API for file deletion.

The MIME type of files can be queried. This is particularly useful for
dcache-view which can now show a file type specific icon.

#### gPlazma can parse IGTF info files

The x509 gPlazma plugin can now parse IGTF info files and generate IGTF
policy principals. These are currently unused.

#### Migration module can now define target pool by attached HSM

A new `-target=hsm` option was added to the migration commands to
define target pools in terms of attached HSM system.

#### Option to disable h-flag update after upload

Pools set a flag in the level 2 name space entry after upload to
indicate whether the file is uploaded to a tape connected area or
not. This is mostly a historic flag and most sites do not use
it. Pools now have an option to disable this update, which reduces
latency upon upload, load on the namespace database and the namespace
disk requirements.


#### Support for Third Party WebDAV copy for OpenID connect authenticated sesssions

The WebDAV door support third party copy for clients that authenticate
through OpenID connect. See configuration details in
`/usr/share/dcache/defaults/webdav.properties`.

Somewhat related, the gPlazma `multimap` plugin has gained support for mapping
OpenID connect groups.

#### NFS

The NFS support now has better support for the Mac OS NFS 4 client due
much improved lock support.

The NFS door now detects when pools are disabled and informs NFS
clients to no longer connect to such a pool. This means that read
transfers can now survive pool restarts, and can possible be
redirected to another pool containing another replica of the
file. Disabling a pool in pool manager will trigger a p2p copy of open
files to allow NFS clients to be redirected.

The NFS pool selection logic has been refined to avoid live lock in
case of high latency pools (either because the pool is very busy or
because of a high latency WAN connection).
