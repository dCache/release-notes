<h1>What's new in dCache 6.1<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

- Optional TLS for p2p transfers
- Zone-aware cell messaging
- New serialization format

## Incompatibilities

Starting release 6.1 the `BerkeleyDBMetaDataRepository` is the default metadata repository for the pools.
Sites that was not explicitly specifying `pool.plugins.meta` property have to set the old default value:
```
pool.plugins.meta=org.dcache.pool.repository.meta.file.FileMetaDataRepository
```

Pool in 6.1.x are not compatible with older dcap doors. However, new dcap doors can operate with existing
pools.

## Release 6.1.31

### dcache-core

The old web pages claim the transfer size and speed are reported in KB and KB/s, although the actually used units are KiB and KiB/s. 
Reporting the correct unit is important for monitoring. This is now fixed.


### gplazma


dCache may now be configured so that the multimap `oidc` predicates
match the `sub` claim value from a specific OAuth2 Provider using the
format SUBVALUE@OP, where `OP` is the dCache-internal alias for the OP.
Existing multimap configuration continues to work, but admin is warned
to update the multimap configuration.

## Release 6.1.29

### ftp


Globus transfer agent is now able to create symbolic links.

### pool

dCacheView now works for redirected transfers for non-anonymous data
access, provided the WebDAV door is using TLS encryption and is
configured with 'webdav.redirect.allow-https' set to 'true'. 


### poolmanager


A very rare race-condition is fixed that could be triggered if a pool
completes a stage or pool-to-pool request (to satisfy a client's read
request) immediately before dying.

### webdav

dCacheView is able to view and download files when authenticated and
when the WebDAV door proxies the transfer.

## Release 6.1.28

### frontend


frontend/api readers and writers always zero issue is fixed now

### gplazma

The LDAP plugin behaviuor now more closely follows that of other mapping
plugins. This allows deployments where LDAP is tried first and, if that

## Release 6.1.26

### poolmanager

When poolmanager requests that a pool stage a file, the pool may return
the special error code HSM_DELAY_ERROR (10013). On receiving this
error, poolmanager suspends the request.

This is now fixed.

### xrootd


xrootd4j is updated to  3.5.10.

## Release 6.1.24

### Changes affecting multiple services

Sometimes file checksums are missing in namespace. Transfer requiring checksum verification fails then with an error saying that "No checksums found", but doesn't log a stack trace server side anymore.

### dcache-xroot

During periods of heavy usage on a pool node, if I/O stalls during read, the xroot client may try to reconnect and continue reading. This release fixes a bug which fails the transfer on the attempted reconnect with a "uuid no longer valid" error (because the file mover has already been closed and removed).  Clients should now be able to resume reading the file on retry.

information sent by the door along with the login result.

### common

Printing of bearer tokens is improved to provide better assurance that
bearer tokens are not leaked.

### gplazma

All login failures are now recoreded in pinboard as a single-line
summary, explaining why the login attempt failed.

### webdav

The current release fixed  a regression where dCache would complain about badly formatted IPv6
addresses, preventing those addresses from being included in the access
log files.

## Release 6.1.22

### webdav

Restarting transfermanager while there are ongoing HTTP-TPC transfers no
longer results in an endless loop, with transfermanager logging a
message every ~5 seconds per ongoing HTTP-TPC transfer.

## Release 6.1.21

### biiling

The current relase fixed  unit info for bandwidth measurements in billing.properties (bytes/sec, not MiB/sec).


### frontend

Frontend now logs any time it returns 500 Internal Server Error to the
client.

dcache-view Previously displayed   MB/sec for transfer rate, but the
value is the old KB/sec. This is now improved and pages display the values advertised.


### pool

The current release assures  now  that  checksum scanner wiill mark files broken and sends alarm.


### webdav

An HTTP-TPC transfer will abort automatically if transfer-manager is
restarted, without waiting for the client (FTS) to time-out.

## Release 6.1.20

### book


A new section is added to the xrootd chapter explaining the need for
SAN extensions on the hostcert in the case of hostname aliasing.

### ftp

Globus transfer service can now list directories that contain incomplete
files, those that are still being uploaded.

The FTP no longer leaking sockets when dynamically calculating file
checksums (e.g., MD5). In practise, this issue only affects transfers
via the Globus transfer service.

The current release fixed  Globus transfer service directory listing for `medium` size
directories.

The current release fixed  Globus transfers hanging when `verify file integrity after transfer`
is enabled and the pool is not configured to calculate an MD5 checksum.

Honour the `ftp.net.internal` configuration property for dynamic
checksum calculation.

## Release 6.1.19

### pool

The current release fix a problem where, under heavy load, redirected https transfers result
in garbled SSL information, preventing the HTTP client from working.

### services

Recovery processe in the case where a pool's message queue is overloaded,
as old (and now useless) requests may be simply discarded is improved.


### webdav

There were  reports of the access log file missing entries. This problem
seems to be triggered if the client disconnects before dCache has
finished processing the request, which is certainly true for cancelled
HTTP-TPC transfers. This is now fixed.

### xrootd

The xroot protocol access log entries for the xrootd door and pool have
been enhanced to include information about the kXR_query requests.

## Release 6.1.14

### enstore

Enstore storage info provides works with URI based tape locations now.

### pool


The HTTP-TPC PUSH requests (which use the HTTP PUT request to send data)
are now more robust against slow remote servers that redirect the
transfer.

The current release fixed  NullPointerException bug in MongoDB-backed pool metadata storage 
and SpotBugs NORMAL-level warning.

With the chenges introduced in current release, when using HTTP-TPC, the timeouts dCache pool uses when requesting
information from the remote server have been adjusted, based on
operational experience. In general, dCache will now wait longer for the
remote server to complete any post-processing before giving up and
failing the transfer.

## Release 6.1.10

### dcache

There have been several occasions where in a dCache instance using an embedded ZooKeeper server such HA services stopped working because 
an ephemeral node was elected leader that has no associated service anymore; it should have been deleted. 
This state might go undetected for a longer time, and removing such stale nodes in order for the services to continue functioning as intended requires manual intervention.

This is fixed now and the functioning of HA services using ZooKeeper-based leader elections is more reliable.

### resilience

A more robust handling of PSU changes which remove pool, unit or group
mappings was introduced.

Recently introduced improvements changed the way resilience handles file "removal"
(no longer setting the repository entry to 'removed'
but simply by caching the replica).
This change, however, did not take into account
the handling of broken files.  Encountering
a broken file, it would indiscriminately attempt
to remove it, whether it was cached or not;
this was leading to an infinite loop, with the
file operation continuously iterating without
doing any further work. This situation could potentially hang the pool scans
(if there are as many broken files as there are
scan threads), and even the file operation
queue. The current release fixed this issue and there is no  any potential for stalled
operations when encountering broken replicas.

## Release 6.1.9

### macaroons

Fixed macaroons validation where in case of multiple combined caveats for some of them only the digital signature was checked.

### resilience

If a FileOperation is canceled while its subtask is running a NullPointerException was thrown. This is now fixed.

### cleaner

Database passwords can now be stored in a dedicated file.


### pool

Failing HTTP-TPC transfers where the remote party sends a 
malformed RFC 3230 checksum value are now fixed.


### util

The current release fixed pgpass file handling for jdbc URLs with options, like 
jdbc:postgresql://dbhost:5432/foo?prepareThreshold=3

## Release 6.1.6

### common

dCache no longer logs OIDC access tokens or macaroon.


The current release fixed  a bug where SRM complains `enum constant IGTF_LOA_CEDER does not
exist`.

### dcache

Priviously we have introduced support for the xrootd cgi `tried=,`, which was  an optional feature because this exclusion
can put access to the file into an indefinitely suspended state for all clients.

The current relase fixed the latter problem and when 'tried' is activated (the only time
excluded hosts can be non-empty), failure to read the file will not put the
request container into the SUSPENDED state.

### dcache-xrootd

The version is upgrated to xrootd4j 3.5.7 with lossen username validation, so that

usernames like `foo.1234:56` are no longer rejected. 


The current release fixed  java.lang.IllegalStateException: ChecksumChannel must not be written to after getChecksums.

TPC client first will be shut down when
the pool netty channel goes inactive.



### pnfsmanager


The current release fixed a  NullPointerException when a file is deleted while a directory listing
is being compiled.

### pool

When a legacy mover is killed by job timeout manager thread interruption
mechanism is used. As mover thread is taken from a thread pool, the next
task might see this interrupted state, if not cleared. This state can be
checked bu other components and trigger false errors: java.lang.InterruptedException THREAD_INTERRUPTED: InterruptedException.

This is now fixed and  pool is not disabled itself after slow running mover is killed by jtm.

## Release 6.1.4

### frontend


The frontend's inotify-over-SSE now honour the 'frontend.root'
configuration property and any user-specific root.  This
means that, for any inotify subscription, the path is
calculated relative to the doors' root and the user-specific root.
For many dCache sites, this has no impact as they are using the
default for both; however, the user root is used to implement the
macaroon's 'root' caveat.  The current release  fixed how inotify
subscription requests are processed when made with a macaroon with a 'root'
caveat.



### pool

When making an HTTP third-party copy (HTTP-TPC), dCache no longer sends
the 'Authorization' HTTP request header in any subsequent request when
the remote server responds with a redirection.



The unix xrootd tpc security plugin was included in order to
enable the dCache TPC client to use a dCache pool as source
when signed hash verification is on. However, this is now fixed  and
no special configuration necessary for organizations (like Tier 1)
needing to communicate with EOS.

## Release 6.1.3

### frontend

When frontend is run in a core domain and there is
no history service reachable, the retry on no route
to cell ends up spamming the message queues. This is now fixed.


### login-broker

The `lb set update` command ignored the provided value and set the
existing one again. This is now fixed and  `lb update time`s can be modified through admin interface.

### xrootd

The current release fixed compatible level security for sigver. 

The xrootd client has a command-line option, `--path`, which
tells the server to create missing directories. This option
is included in two-party copy, but setting it for TPC has
no effect. TPCs which wish to write to dCache (as destination)
to a non-existent subdirectory fail. This is now fixed and dCache no longer fails in these cases.

## Release 6.1.2

### nearline-storage

There were issues  in pool space allocation/de-allocation in conjunction
to HSM connectivity and handling restore errors resulting in failing stage end up with used space miscalculation:
`pool_read, fault occurred in repository: Internal repository error. Pool restart required:,
 cause: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot set used space to a negative value`.

This is now fixed and disk copy is removed if restore from HSM failed.

## Release 6.1.1

### dcache

Qos migration policy engine was  raising JVM error when no tape pool found. 
This is now fixed and the normal behavior is that HTTP error code reported back with `No HSM pool found`.

### frontend

The current release improved error responses and they are more specific  now.

The current release fixed the NPE  stack trace arised because the pool
data could be sent with a default sweeper data
object.

## Release 6.1.0

### Cells

Starting with release 6.1.0 dCache internal massage routing will prefer zone local cells when possible.
This is benefitial in geo-distributed HA setups, where talking to remote cells may introduce additional
latency.

A new serializer is available in dCache, which improves the speed of internal message passing between cells.
As this feature has not been tested very extensively and it's possible that sites may experience unforeseen
behavior, the new serializer has to be explicitly enabled as:
 
```dcache.broker.channel.msg-payload-serializer = experimental```

NOTE: when different cells are not of the same bug-fix release, then dCache will always fall back to using the standard
serialization protocol.

### Chimera
Removed unneccesary requests to DB on new file creation.
Fixed operation with read-only database cponnections.

### Frontend

As part of the effort (in progress) to provide enhanced support for QoS,
the RESTful QoS transition API and implementation has been revisited.
First, the way QoS was being evaluated (counting all pins) has been 
corrected by using a QoS owned pin.  Next, in addition to pinning,  
QoS changes now involve modification of the access latency and  
retention policy values for the file in the namespace.  The frontend
notifies PnfsManager of these transitions, and this notification
then gets relayed to resilience.  Some internal refactoring of 
the QoS logic out of frontend and into core was also done.

An inefficiency resulting in the double fetch of sweeper data
from the pools was fixed.  

The restores and transfers admin pages were erroneously requiring 
user login; this has been eliminated.

For the API enabling and disabling pools, a bug preventing the
expression of the flag using a boolean rather than a string, e.g.,
```
pools/{name}/usage/mode -d {"rdonly":true} 
```
rather than
```
pools/{name}/usage/mode -d {"rdonly":"true"})
```
has been fixed.

### History

Some commands available on the frontend for refreshing and adjusting
the timeout of pool data collection were missing from the history service;
these have now been made available.

Also addressed were null pointer issues arising from the arrival of
incompletely initialized data from the pools; code was refactored to
make sure composed objects do not have empty fields; in addition,
a few extra checks for missing data are now made.

### NFS
The admin command 'show clients' is updated to accept `address/netmask` or `pattern` as a host argument,
for example:
```
admin > show clients 10.1.1.0/24
admin > show clients fe80::eef4:bbff:fed2:f9d0
admin > show clients wn*.dcache.org
```

### PNFS Manager

Notification is now sent when access latency or retention policy changes for a file
(in order to support the RESTful transition API and management of QoS by resilience).

### Pool
Starting from 6.1.0 the pool to pool transfers can be optionaly configured to use TLS. A new propertry
`pool.enable.encrypted.p2p-transfers` is introduced that accepts three values:

 - NEVER: TLS is never used for p2p transfers
 - ALWAYS: all p2p transfers aare using TLS
 - CROSSZONES: TLS is used only when source and dstination pools are in different zones.
 
NOTE, that in the current implementation `CROSSZONES` has the same effect as `ALWAYS`.

The BerkeleyDBMetaDataRepository is now default format for pools metadata.

An inefficiency in the processing of sweeper data for frontend histogram display,  
which could result in CPU spiking on the pool node, has been fixed via an in-memory
optimization replacing callouts to the repository store.

The pool transfer service now incorporates both older and newer xrootd version
numbers for compatibility (2.7, 4).

### Pool Manager

The network hostname of the pool is now made available to the selection unit
in order to support the xrootd 'tried' query element; a small fix was also 
added to restore backward compatibility with older pools that do not so advertise 
their host name to the pool monitor.

The selection algorithm has been modified to support excluding tried hosts.

### Resilience

Modifications were made to couple resilience more tightly to QoS transition requests; 
it can now manage transitions for "resilient" files between tape and disk.  This means that it will 
make replicas for a NEARLINE file which has become ONLINE, and can cache all replicas for an 
ONLINE file that has become NEARLINE, provided that the file belongs to a storage unit 
with a non-null '-required' value.

A small bug (null pointer exception) which could occur if a file staged from tape no longer exists 
on any pool that is part of a resilient poolgroup has been fixed.   There were also two minor 
code improvements involving object comparisons.

### XRootD

The dCache XrootD door now observes the xrootd protocol 'tried=host1,host2,...' query element.  
What this means is that if the xrootd client (xrdcp) should decide to retry a failed transaction 
by returning to the dCache door, the hosts listed as having been previously tried will be used
to exclude potential pools for the transfer.  Should no other pools be available, dCache
will behave the same as when a file is unavailable (it will wait indefinitely until the client
gives up).

Pool and door compatibility based on changed version numbers has now been fixed so that
older doors will work with newer pools and vice versa.

Error handling (mapping of error types to codes returned to the xrootd client) was
refined to make it more consistent and conform more closely with the xrootd protocol.

The version number indicated by dCache now should reflect the actual xrootd protocol
version being used (it was formerly fixed, incorrectly, at 2.7).

The xrootd client is now redirected to the pool using an actual hostname rather than
IP address, for the sake of compatibility with RFC 5280 (4.2.1.6.  
Subject Alternative Name).  This is essential for eventual support of TLS.

Two internal changes in advance of future features (TLS, SciTokens) have been
made:  the door now uses a caching login strategy, similarly to most of the
other dCache doors; it also supports authorization handlers which need
to access login strategies (both of these will be necessary for SciTokens).

A bug in the delegation provider requiring that a VOMS directory be defined even 
if the GSI module is not being used has been fixed.

A bug preventing read paths from being observed by the list command has been fixed.

A bug preventing  xrdcp -C &lt;checksum type&gt; from returning the correct checksum
when multiple checksums are defined on the pools has been fixed.

### Batch/Startup scripts

The batch scripts for the alarms service and xrootd doors were erroneously configured not to
exit and restart on fatal errors; if there were unhandled exceptions during startup, these
two services would simply hang, making detection of their status (e.g., through external 
monitoring) difficult.  The scripts have been fixed to conform to the exit/restart
sequence used by all other services.
