<h1>What's new in dCache 11.1<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

- NFSv4.1 Read-delegation support

## Incompatibilities

- Drop support for nfsv4_1_files layout type.
- Drop admin commands to set/get/list `flags` associated with files.
- Obsolete `pool.enable.hsm-flag`.
- Stop populating of `t_storageinfo` chimera table.
- Removed Legacy admin shell

## Acknowledgments

We want to thank Tino Reichardt for his contribution.


## Release 11.1.1

### gplazma

To ensure consistent role enforcement across dCache, GPlazma will now set the RolePrincipal whenever the role attribute is present.

### nfs

To reduce log clutter for our admins, the NFS client workaround message was downgraded in severity.

### poolmanager

This fix takes care of the infinite loop conflict in wrandom partition which was introduced by commit 778f97.

## Release 11.1.0

### Admin

dCache allowed admins to associate key-value (flags) pairs with files, which were stored in pnfs level-2 (t_lavel_2 table).
Those flags did not influence the dcache behavior and were invisible to users. This functionality is removed now.

The ssh admin interface could start the legacy shell with an alternative way to address dCache cells (cd vs. \c). This functionality
is removed now. Any custom scripts that might depend on such functionality must be updated.



### Chimera

The dCache namespace stored so-called `flags`, key-value pairs associated with files, in the `t_level_2` table. This functionality is removed as it is not being used.
The `t_level_2` is not touched and stays as-is. The table should be empty for most sites or contain no new records since 2018. Admins are free to truncate the table to
reclaim the space, if desired.

The storage info of a file is defined by directory tags, such as `OSMTemplate` and `sGroup` or `storage_group` and `file_family`. Additionally, after file is flushed in HSM, the storage info was stored in `t_storageinfo` table. This was required to be able to restore the file with the original storageinfo, even if directory tags are changed. However, the functionality was never used by sites. With release 11.1, dCache stops populating and reading `t_storageinfo` table.

### Cleaner

Previously, `cleaner-hsm` would send one delete request per HSM at a time to a single pool each. However, this level of parallelization is not very efficient, especially when the delete times out.
Now, for each HSM, it can delete files in parallel via multiple pools. Instead of waiting for one delete request batch per HSM to finish or time out, it will send further delete requests for that HSM to other pools connected to it on successive `cleaner-hsm` runs. By decreasing the time between successive runs, the number of parallel cleaning pools is increased (as long as there are available pools).



### DCAP

Removed the capability of  associating a checksum as a key-value pair on upload. The checksum had never been used by dCache or exposed to users.





### gplazma

Added multimap plugin section in the dCache book.



### httpd

The pool  and pool group usage pages have been updated to display data volumes in a human-readable form.



### Monitoring

With release 11.1, dCache comes with an integrated prometheus-exporter that can be enabled by `dcache.enable.prometheus.exporter=true` property. The property `dcache.enable.prometheus.exporter.endpoint`
controls on which interface and port number the exporter is exposed. The default value is `localhost:9876`. There are not too many metrics available righ now, however, the exporter can be used to monitor
JVM memory, number of running threads, or number of open files.

### NFS

NFS door supports read-delegation. Read delegations allow the server to delegate OPEN-CLOSE operations to clients if a file is accessed several times. This functionality aims to improve file access latency in workloads like `open->read-close; loop`, which some HPC applications use.

In order to provide delegation-based read access on dCache pools, the `nfsv4_1_files` layout type is no longer supported. Site admins must remove the `lt=nfsv4_1_files` option from nfs door export files.

>NOTE: As the client will not return delegations right after transfer, the NFS movers on pools might stay active even if no applications have opened the file. Moreover, the `transferTime` and `transferSize`  correspond to a file delegation period and do not reflect a single `open->close` cycle.





### Pool

Berkeley DB, which is used to store metadata on pools, by default keeps only 100 files open. On some installations, this causes a slow start, as the number of db files is much larger. Now, the default is increased to 512.

On data upload, dCache pool can tell PnfsManager whatever pool's `lfs` mode is `hsm` or `precious`. This functionality is controlled by `pool.enable.hsm-flag` option, which defaults to `false` since 2017.
This option is now obsolete.
