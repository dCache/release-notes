<h1>What's new in dCache 11.1<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

- NFSv4.1 Read-delegation support

## Incompatibilities

- Drop support for nfsv4_1_files layout type
- Drop admin commands to set/get/list `flags` associated with files.
- Obsolete `pool.enable.hsm-flag`

## Acknowledgments

## Release 11.1.0

### Admin

dCache allowed admins to associate key-value (flags) pairs with files, which were stored in pnfs level-2 (t_lavel_2 table).
Those flags did not influence the dcache behavior and were invisible to users. This functionality is removed now.

### Billing

### Chimera

The dCache namespace stored so-called `flags`, key-value pairs associated with files, in the `t_level_2` table. This functionality is removed as it is not being used.
The `t_level_2` is not touched and stays as-is. The table should be empty for most sites or contain no new records since 2018. Admins are free to truncate the table to
reclaim the space, if desired.

### Cleaner

Previously, `cleaner-hsm` would send one delete request per HSM at a time to a single pool each. However, this level of parallelization is not very efficient, especially when deletes time out.
Now, for each HSM, it can delete files in parallel via multiple pools. Instead of waiting for one delete request batch per HSM to finish or time out, it will send further delete requests for that HSM to other pools connected to it on successive `cleaner-hsm` runs. By decreasing the time between successive runs, the number of parallel cleaning pools is increased (as long as there are available pools).

### Checksums

### DCAP

Removed the capability of  associating a checksum as a key-value pair on upload. The checksum had never been used by dCache or exposed to users.

### Frontend

### FTP

### gplazma

Added multimap plugin section in the dCache book.

### History

### Hoppingmanager

### httpd

### Info

### Missing Files

### NFS

NFS door supports read-delegation. Read delegations allow the server to delegate OPEN-CLOSE operations to clients if a file is accessed several times. This functionality aims to improve file access latency in workloads like `open->read-close; loop`, which some HPC applications use.

In order to provide delegation-based read access on dCache pools, the `nfsv4_1_files` layout type is no longer supported. Site admins must remove the `lt=nfsv4_1_files` option from nfs door export files.

>NOTE: As the client will not return delegations right after transfer, the NFS movers on pools might stay active even if no applications have opened the file. Moreover, the `transferTime` and `transferSize`  correspond to a file delegation period and do not reflect a single `open->close` cycle.

### Pinmanager

### PNFS Manager

### Pool

Berkeley DB, which is used to store metadata on pools, by default keeps only 100 files open. On some installations, this causes a slow start, as the number of db files is much larger. Now, the default is increased to 512.

On data upload, dCache pool can tell PnfsManager whatever pool's `lfs` mode is `hsm` or `precious`. This functionality is controlled by `pool.enable.hsm-flag` option, which defaults to `false` since 2017.
This option is now obsolete.

### Poolmanager

### Resilience

### Space Manager

### SRM

### Statistics
