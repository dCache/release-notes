<h1>What's new in dCache 9.1<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

- Improve concurrent file create rate in a single directory

## Incompatibilities

- Starting version 9.1 the nlink count for directories shows only number of subdirectories. Thus, the existing
  nlink count can be out-of-sync with we no automatic re-synchronization is performed.
- dropped gplazma support for XACML
- pool binds TCP port for `http` and `xroot` movers on startup

## Release 9.1.9

### bulk

No more NPE/stack trace in the bulk `PIN` activity.

Online files should not accumulate useless user pins anymore.

### cli

No more false stack trace/bug output on the admin shell.

### gplazma

dCache will now accept non-targeted explicit AuthZ statements in the scope claim (e.g., storage.read). dCache will consider tokens containing compute explicit AuthZ statements but without any storage explicit AuthZ statements as tokens with explicit authorisation; the lack of any storage explicit authorisation statements will result in all requests with that token being denied.

dCache should continue to accept JWTs for longer, if there is a problem with the OP.

### pool

No more logged stack traces due to IllegalStateException: Attribute is not defined: SIZE errors.

## Release 9.1.7

### logback

Redundant replications of unused log files are removed and the qos activity is now recorded as well.

### qos

A bug was fixed that let to the message queue being blocked.

### webdav

This patch speeds up listing of directories through webdav.
All attributes are no longer supported/returned from PROPFIND, unless you set the following property on the WebDav door:

```
#  --- Default PROPFIND properties
#
#  The PROPFIND request allows a client to discover information
#  (properties) of dCache content.  When making a PROPFIND request,
#  the client normally indicates which properties are of interest.  If
#  not specified then the WebDAV server (dCache) is free to return a
#  default set of information.
#
#  Certain clients make PROPFIND requests without specifying
#  the desired set of properties, triggering a default set of
#  properties.  There are two problems with this: first, the
#  clients may react badly if information is missing from this default;
#  second, some of the required properties may have an adverse
#  performance impact for dCache.
#
#  This property controls whether to support client-side requests for
#  properties beyond a minimal set or not.
#
#      PERFORMANCE -- always return only a minimal set of information that does
#                     not incur any additional overhead. (These are basically
#                     the same as what a POSIX list request would proviode).
#
#      CLIENT_COMPATIBLE -- return the set of information required by
#                     the clients.  If the client does not specify the properties,
#                     it will get a maximal default set.
#
#  Because the performance impact of the latter under the most common usage scenarios
#  could be considerable, the default is set to PERFORMANCE.
#
(one-of?PERFORMANCE|CLIENT_COMPATIBLE)webdav.default-propfind-properties = PERFORMANCE
```

## Release 9.1.6

### bulk

Each time a bulk request is started, the container is given a new semaphore based on the number of permits defined for the activity in question.
This patch sets the default per-container permit values to something more reasonable.

### pool

Removes hidden default values for pool properties.

## Release 9.1.5

### dcache-bulk


Changes were recently made to hold statistical
counts of requests and targets in memory for
the sake of efficiency. However, running target
counts are still problematic. This is
especially true if a request is cancelled.

This is now fixed and the `running` count, which can be confusing
and inaccurate, is not longer displayed.


RT 10496: Odd errors in Bulk logs for some requests in 9.1.0

This ticket uncovered a bug in the abort procedure.

The stored targets were not cancelled  on abort. this is now fixed.

### dcache-xroot

 Improve efficiency of stat list (`ls -l`) has been introduced.

`ls -l` returns in approximately the
same amount of time as a non-stat listing
`ls`.

### pool

When a hsm provider was dynamically loaded, it doesn't appear in the pools setup file after using save.

this is now fixed and When executing save, hsm load is written to the setup-file.


### xrootd4j

Upgraded to 4.5.8 which improves handling/logging of Ssl exceptions.

## Release 9.1.4

### dchache

By default dcache provides very conservative heap and direct memory sizes, namely 512m. Many sites have adjusted the heap size, but usually keep the direct memory size as-is. 
The recent nfs changes require the direct memory to at least 3% of the heap sizes direct memory shared by xroot mover pools have hard times to serve the data and fail with OOME.

This is now fixed.

### pnfsmanager

List scheduling behavior is now optional.

`pnfsmanager.enable.parallel-listing`  property variable  allows to restore previous behavior - listing requests
 are dispatched to a single queue that is prrocessed by multiple parallel workers.

dCache admin can change behavior of listing scheduler.

## Release 9.1.3

### dcache-bulk


`prestore` was added as a bulk request option originally in order
to allow immediate retrieval of target paths. When it was then
discovered that lazy storing of the initial paths was not a
workable idea, this option applied only to targets discovered
via recursion.

However, the rationale for storing the entire tree of targets before beginning the processing does not really exist.
The additional semantics, which complicate modifications (should they be desirable), of prestorage are no longer maintained.

### gplazma


gPlazma incompatibiliti detween version before and after 8.2.13 has been detected.

This is now fixed.

### pool


If http client issues two GET requests then zero-copy enabled http mover will try to remove the IdleStateHandler 
twice and fail with NoSuchElementException.

This is now fixed.

### qos

A  bug in storing and retrieving `tried` value for verify operation has been fixed.

### xroot


Modify mkdir to ignore dir exists on make parent option. The result conforms to vanilla xroot server.

## Release 9.1.2

### rpm

The java dependency was changed as dCache is not a desktop application and therefore java-11-headless is sufficient.

### vehicles

This patch fixes a bug where an Exception was thrown while handling relative paths in resolve symlink messages.

## Release 9.1.1

### bulk

RuntimeExceptions should not cause the request ls to fail globally.

### frontend

If the user root contains a symlink, or the target path contains a symlink pertaining
to the user root, some REST calls to /api/v1/namespace and /api/v1/id failed. This is fixed now.

All of the REST GET methods now allow anonymous
users to get the data if the global property
allows it. In the case of NONE, 401 not authorized
is returned at login.

### nfs

A race condition was fixed that let to sending a READ request to a pool when the mover was alreay stopped.

### pnfs

With this version, symlinks are skipped when checking restrictions to speed-up directory listing.

### qos

Two small incompatibilities with subject and attributes are fixed.

The behaviour was changed to not scan all pools on startup or periodic rescanning of all pools outside
the periodic window.

Improvements in triggering QoS operation queues, which reduces the potential for queue starvation.

A bug was fixed that prevented the bulk request to complete.

The error reporting of aborted verification was improved to get a better understanding, what went wrong.

### xrootd

A missing vomsdir is now throwing an exception instead of a stacktrace.

### xrootd4j

Update xrootd4j to a new version, that fixes a byte buffer leak in ZTNCredentialUtils.

:   dcache-bulk:  catch Exception from getSubject()

## Release 9.1.0

### Bulk

There have been a few smaller bug fixes which improve consistency in the request info returned to the user,
in treating non-existent vs invalid paths differently, and in counting targets according to state
in the admin shell.  Propagation of the Subject has also been added to PIN and STAGE requests so
as to assure that PinManager does the correct permission checks.  Finally, the request policy
defaults have been changed to conform with the most prevalent usage (WLCG TAPE); concurrent requests per user
is now set to 5000, with the size of each request set to 500 targets.

### Chimera, Core, Security, Bulk, Frontend, Xroot

With dCache 9 we have introduced symlink resolution on both target paths and user roots/prefixes.
This means that restrictions for ACLs as well as token claims will now resolve both
the allowable path as well as the target path before making a determination as to permissions.

### Frontend

A new REST API has been added which allows one to retrieve information concerning pool migration jobs,
`/api/v1//migrations`.  See the SWAGGER page for description and parameters.

Several other enhancements have been made, including a more detailed description of Bulk request objects,
improved error messages, improved SWAGGER annotations for the TAPE API and for paging offsets on Bulk requests.
Finally, support for relative paths in the target list of Bulk and TAPE API requests has been enabled.

### gPlazma

Besides dropping the XACML plugin and discontinuing gPlazma 1 (making Revocation entries defunct),
the OIDC plugin has been modified to support the suppress option, to allow suppression of offline
verification, and to allow the suppression of audience claim verification.  Documentation
on OIDC has been added ("Introduction to multimap and OIDC Plug-ins in dCache") to `The Book`.
Selected JWT claims are now also printed for failed logins.

### Packaging

The rpm package will call `systemctl daemon-reload` after install or update.

### Pinmanager

### PnfsManager

The chimera layer supports two new Java properties that control parent directory attribute update on create:

 - chimera_lazy_wcc
 - chimera_soft_update
 
 The `chimera_lazy_wcc` option instructs dCache not to update directory attributes immediately. Instead, the desired information is stored
 in an additional `t_lazy_wcc` table that is periodically merged into `t_inodes`. This behavior improves the concurrent file creation rate for a single directory.
 The attribute syncronization time is hard-coded to 30 seconds.
 
 The `chimera_soft_update` option tells dCache to check for pending updates in `t_lazy_wcc` on `stat` calls. This option should be enabled if the 30-second
 attribute merge time can't be used (typically for NFS write based workloads).


### Pool

Added possibility to dynamically add and remove nearline storage providers; this allows one to update the provider without
restarting dCache:

```
    (pool_write@dCacheDomain) admin > hsm show providers

```

The `mover ls` command has been updated to display the remote peer's IP address for Xroot and HTTP movers.

The `st/rh/rm kill` admin commands accept `*` to cancel all running requests.

The Kafka message includes the pool's local socket address used by the transfer.

Before release 9.1, Xroot and HTTP movers were binding their TCP port upon the first request, shutting down the
socket when no movers were left running. Henceforward, dCache will bind these ports on startup and keep them
for the entire JVM lifetime.

### SystemCell

The system cell provides two new commands, `jfr start` and `jfr stop`, to start and stop the Java Flight
Recorder directly from the admin interface. More Information about Flight Recorder and dCache can be found at
[debug section](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/docs/TheBook/src/main/markdown/cookbook-debugging.md) in the dCache Book.
The JFR can be started with one of the pre-defined JVM-supplied configurations or with a custom configuration file.

### WebDav

Subsequent to an upgrade of the bootstrap library, certain visual features of the GUI were broken; these
have now been repaired.  Two other bugs were fixed (return empty list instead of null for
empty collections; preserving URL of the request in protocol information).

### Xroot

Two bug fixes have been made, one to restore the proper handling of single-slash paths, the
other to fix erroneous permission denied exceptions when `POSC` (`persist on successful close`) 
is used. 

Xroot now also supports the use of user-root relative paths like other doors (e.g., WebDav and FTP).
