<h1>What's new in dCache 9.2<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

- Performance improvements for the concurrent directory creation and removal

## Acknolagements

Many Thanks to Lars Jansse and Sandro Grizzo for their contributions.

## Incompatibilities

- prior to version 9.2 dCache NFSv4.1 door will publish only `nfs4_1_files` layout. Now on
  the door publishes all available layout types
- dropped reference count tracking for directory tags
- dropped support of java options `chimera_soft_update` and `chimera_lazy_wcc` in favor of `chimera.attr-consistency` property
- If upgrading from 8.2, be sure to read also the release notes for 9.0 and 9.1, important changes are described there. See the [9.2 migration guide](https://github.com/dCache/upgrade-guide/blob/master/UPGRADE92.md) for more complete information
- With version 9.2.8+, empty and non-existent banfiles will be treated the same

## Release 9.2.40

### quota


The current release added protocol compliant return codes on quota exceeded exception.

### restapi

dCache rest api response filtered out fields that had null or default (for that type) values. 
As the result, for instance, integer filed with 0 value was skipped (so is any filed with null value). 

This is now fixed and Request results returned by dCache rest api contain fields having null or default values.

## Release 9.2.39

### gplazma

Excessive caching of failed login attempts leads to system has been reported.

The current relase fexed that and now following properties could be used to control the overload:


`gplazma.authz.loginFailure.cache.size=10000`

When the cache reaches this size, older entries are evicted.
 Remove the least-recently-used (LRU) entries when that limit is exceeded.
 important: the cache size is an approximate size not exact.

`gplazma.authz.loginFailure.cache-size-expiry=1`

 timeout cache entry life time. By default  expire entries 1 hour after they are written.
 If a key is expired due to time, it is gone even if the cache is not full.

`gplazma.authz.loginFailure.cache-size-expiry.unit=HOURS`

timeout cache entry life time unit.


The current release fixed `BEARER TOKEN` empty case and the empty token should be rejected.

### tape

dcache tape rest API  returned `ONLINE (or DISK)` locality for incomplete files.
Return locality `ONLINE` if locality is `NONE` for files w/ zero size.


### webdav


A bug is fixed that prevented dCaches support for the `X-OC-MTIME` HTTP request header on PUT requests from working. 
Note that, for this patch to be effective, both the WebDAV doors and all pools that accept such upload requests need to be updated.

## Release 9.2.30

### cells

When Zookeeper updates core domain infos, dCache will first kill the existing cell tunnels and then later try to read and parse the new value. 
If the new value is an empty string (for whatever reason), parsing will fail, but a new connection will not be established.
This now fixed.

When a thread performing I/O gets interrupted, then an InterruptedIOException might be thrown. A DCAP mover will treat and propagate such an exception as a disk I/O error, thus disabling the pool. This fix reduces false positive disk I/O errors.

## Release 9.2.25

### bulk

When specifying an empty target, bulk proceeded to process the request instead of failing fast. This is now fixed.

### gplazma

A previous commit, leading to the last bugfix releases being blacklisted, introduced a regression in the multimap plugin. Where the 'op' principal type is used, logins will fail with dCache logging a stacktrace like
`java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to create principal: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: org.dcache.auth.OAuthProviderPrincipal.<init>(java.lang.String)`.
This is now fixed.

## Release 9.2.15

### bulk


Some of the format strings that manage the formatting of command results were sending to the user expect a different 
number of parameters than provided.
This is now fixed and the returned bulk info strings return all expected values.

### info


DGAs send messages to other dCache cells to discover their current status. These messages have a hard-coded one second timeout.

Some queries are data-intensive and could take longer than one second to build the answer, resulting in no information being provided.

this is now fixed and the info service will now wait longer for a cell to respond to a query for information.

### nfs


Grizzly memory management uses heap memory size fraction even if direct memory is used (issue 7529).
This issue has been fixed and  dCache starts with 256m of direct memory.

## Release 9.2.11

Users have reported severe slow down when runnig listing using webdav.

This is currently fixed.

:   [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration

## Release 9.2.10

### webdav


A recent path introduced support for adding the Link HTTP response header, according to RFC 6249. Unfortunately, the code added the Link header for all requests, not just the intended GET and HEAD requests.

Additionally, due to peculiarities of how Milton generates PROPFIND results, the Link header is added multiple times: once for each subdirectory.

This results in the HTTP response headers taking up too much space and dCache failing the request, returning a 500 status code.


This  regression has been now fixed where PROPFIND requests would fail if the directory contains too many subdirectories. The cut-off point depends on the length of the URL the PROPFIND request targets.

## Release 9.2.9

### gplazma

A bug is fixed in gPlazma that is triggered when users attempt to authenticate with broken gPlazma configuration or a gPlazma plugin's configuration is broken.


### Changelog 9.2.8..9.2.9

:   [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration

## Release 9.2.8

### chimera

A recent commit as a side effect resulted in failure to upload a file to an xroot door with the overwrite ("-f") option, returning okay but removing the original file without creating the new one. This patch reverts the offending commit: copy with an overwrite flag works again.

### CI

Improve build pipeline.

### gplazma

Previously, a missing banfile would result in every successive login attempt failing with an NPE. Now, even if configured, an empty or inexistent banfile will be ignored and logins should succeed.
WARNING: This changes the banfile plugin behaviour! Empty and non-existent banfiles will be treated the same.

### system-test

Increases the small default direct memory value for system-test: NFS on system-test works again.

### webdav

Update webdav door to retry the request to the namespace if checksum is not present in files attributes.

### xroot

A recent commit introduced handling of relative paths in xrootd with inadvertent side effect of dropping support xroot.root variable. This patch reverts that commit: pre-9.2 behavior is restored.

## Release 9.2.7

### ci

Build and test system improvements.

### cleaner-disk

No more occasional ConcurrentHashMap exceptions in cleaner-disk
runs due to concurrent pool status changes.

### core

Admin commands with hyphen-containing arguments are no longer trunkated
prematurely, they are now properly shown and autocompleted.

### qos

Prevent `PropertySetterException` in qos.

### xroot

The change to use effectiveRoot did not take into account Subject = Nobody.

Regression eliminated, previous behavior with anonymous read restored.

Fixes previous fix for xroot descriptor: NPE risk mitigated.

## Release 9.2.5

### bulk

The current releae  fixed handling of uncaught exception.

### dcache-view

dCache-view has been updated to 2.1.0 
and it includes modifications to use new RolePrincipal
instead of the roles plugin role, eliminating
the need for additional logins for admin privileges.

### qos


With ingest queues servicing large
numbers of requests, as we have
for performance reasons configured as
defaults on QoS and Bulk, there was a
potential for a race between the
processing of the original modify
request and a subsequent cancellation
request, such that cancellation
could  not find the request as it
was still in the executor queue.

This is fixed now and are is a trailing stream
of requests still being processed
after cancellation (from Bulk)
completes.

were strip  into `/domain.foo/path/to/file`.

The current release fixed the  parsing of urls with two slashes in the path.

## Release 9.2.2

### bulk

A bug was fixed that may lead to the archiver deleting ongoing requests.

### qos

The default size of the task queues are set to "qos.limits.verifier.max-running-operations"
now to increase the throughput.
IMPORTANT: The default size of the QoS Engine's modify thread pool was also
updated to 500 as the current value, 32, is too little.

### webdav

This patch fixes a bug that led to wrong paths on redirects.

## Release 9.2.1

### bulk

Correct bulk cancellation semantics.

The problem with cancellation (hanging
perpetually in the CANCELLING state) was solved.

Return directory listing to its own executor.

Same performance as before, but with a total memory
footprint at a little more than half available
physical memory instead of being very close to it.

Add commands to display the count instead of the
actual entry (as with requests and targets), and
also a command to clear/delete from the archive table.

### documentation

Add commands to display the count instead of the
actual entry (as with requests and targets), and
also a command to clear/delete from the archive table.

Fixes link in documentation.

Add section in WebDAV door chapter on metalink.

## Release 9.2.0

## Known issues

Cancel is currently broken in bulk service and recursive requests could freeze up.

### Admin

Paging capability was added to the AnsiTerminalCommand (and DirectCommand),
where results exceeding 10K lines prompt the user with [Y/N] for
further results.   When executing a shell command in non-terminal
mode, all results are streamed back continuously.  The Bulk commands have
been converted to use this feature.

### Bulk

There have been many small fixes and improvements to this service since 8.2.

The most significant changes or additions include:

-   The storage layer has been redesigned to conserve space and for efficiency/throughput.
    Please note that moving up to the new database schema may require some time.  
    The amount of time can be generally computed in terms of the number of entries in
    the `request_target` table; figure about 1 hour for every 10 million.  If it is
    necessary to maintain all such entries, we recommend you do the upgrade offline,
    using the `dcache database update` command-line tool.  If there is no need to keep 
    completed requests in the database, we would advise truncation or at least deletion 
    of the completed requests before the upgrade.

-   Periodic archiving of requests has been added; this is configurable via properties
    and admin commands.  The archive table maintains an abbreviated summary of the 
    requests, and can be purged via admin command as well.

-   The container job has been rewritten to bring it in line with SRM bringonline performance;
    multithreaded directory listing has also been implemented to improve recursive
    request time-to-completion.

-   Path resolution (for relative paths) has been integrated into bulk request processing.

-   Activity providers now can capture the environment so that defaults can be 
    customized (this presently pertains only to pin and stage lifetime attributes).

-   Support has been added for the QoS update request to handle policy arguments.

-   Bulk has been made replicable (HA).  Please read the requirements
    in the cookbook section on High Availability.

-   The `delay clear` option has been eliminated from bulk requests.

-   The `prestore` option has also been eliminated, as it is no longer necessary
    (since all initial targets are immediately batch stored synchronously)
    before the submission request returns.

A few minor points:  

-   Default limits for request size and number of requests per user have been set on
    the basis of WLCG requirements.

-   The counts displayed by the `info` command are from startup and are cumulative; for
    actual (current) counts based on the data store, use the `status counts` command.

There are numerous properties which have been deprecated, particularly those dealing
with limits.  Please review the bulk.properties file for details.   It should not
be necessary under normal usage to adjust the limits for thread pools, database
connections and semaphores from the defaults.  Depending on the volume of activity
and the site requirements, the archiver period and window may need to be shortened
from the default.  Note that the options for `clearOnSuccess` and `clearOnFailure`
that can be included in an individual bulk request to indicate immediate deletion
are not available for STAGE requests as this feature is not part of the WLCG specification,
so the only way to remove such requests automatically is through the archiver.

### Chimera

With dcache version 9.0 chimera has introduced `chimera_soft_update` and `chimera_lazy_wcc` Java properties to control the behavior
of the parent directory attribute update policy. Now those properties are obsolete and replaced by a regular dcache configuration
property `chimera.attr-consistency`, which takes the following values:

| policy | behaviour                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| strong | a creation of a filesystem object will right away update parent directory's mtime, ctime, nlink and generation attributes                                                                                                                   |
| weak   | a creation of a filesystem object will eventually update (after 30 seconds) parent directory's mtime, ctime, nlink and generation attributes. Multiple concurrent modifications to a directory are aggregated into a single attribute update. |
| soft   | same as weak, however, reading of directory attributes will take into account pending attribute updates.                                                                                                                                    |

Read-write exported NFS doors SHOULD run with `strong consistency` or `soft consistency` to maintain POSIX compliance. Read-only NFS doors might
run with `weak consistency` if non-up-to-date directory attributes can be tolerated, for example, when accessing existing data, or  `soft consistency`,
if up-to-date information is desired, typically when seeking newly arrived files through other doors.

### Frontend

Aside from bug fixes, the following changes should be noted:

-   Support for .well-known/security.txt was added to both the frontend and WebDav ports.
-   More detailed description of request objects for bulk and stage.
-   Improved error messages in several places.
-   Support for relative paths and symlink prefix resolution for bulk and namespace resources.
-   The frontend.wellknown paths have been deprecated in favor of dcache.wellknown. 
-   Authz checks have been removed in Quota GET methods.
-   Use of RolePrincipal (see under gPlazma) replaces reliance on LoginAttributes and the
    old admin role (special gid) as defined by the roles plugin.
-   Support for QoS Rule Engine policies.  A new qos-policy resource allows one to
    add, remove, list and retrieve policy definitions.  See the Swagger pages for details.
-   An -optional query parameter was added to the namespace resource to retrieve extra information 
    about a file; the new QoS Policy file attributes (QOS_POLICY and QOS_STATE) are included
    with this option.
-   Support for pool migration has been introduced (migrations resource).
    See Swagger pages for details.

### gplazma

A RolePrincipal has been added to support the use of role definitions in the multimap file.
Currently the available roles are:  admin, qos-user and qos-group.  The second allows
the user to transition files owned by the user's uid; the third allows the user
to transition files whose group is the user's primary gid.  The two qos roles
can be combined.  Admin grants full admin privileges.  A multimap example:

```
dn:"/DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory/OU=People/CN=Al Rossi/CN=UID:arossi" username:arossi  uid:8773  gid:1530,true roles:admin
```

These roles do not depend on the presence of the roles plugin.  Since the frontend
has been changed to use the new RolePrincipal and not the old role definitions
(where a special gid must be defined), one can easily drop that plugin from
the gplamza.conf file.  

There was also an important fix for a bug that was preventing
upload (e.g., xroot POSC) when using tokens.

The gplazma-xacml plugin has been dropped.

### NFS

Prior to version 9.2 dCache, to support RHEL6 based clients, if no species export options are specified, the NFSv4.1 door
were publishing only `nfs4_1_files` layout. Now on the door publishes all available layout types. If for whatever reason
RHEL6 clients are still used, the old behavior can be enforced by `lt=nfsv4_1_files` export option.

### PNFS Manager

To remove unused directory tags chimera keeps the reference count (nlink) of tags. This approach creates a 'hot' record that
serializes all updates to a given top-level tag. Starting 9.2 dCache doesn't rely on ref count anymore and uses conditional DELETE,
which should improve the concurrent directory creation/deletion rate.

### Pool

The `mover ls` command is updated to display with the `-u` option the subject associated with the mover.

Added `pool.mover.https.port.min` and `pool.mover.https.port.max` to control TPC port number used by HTTPS mover.

Pools `info` command displays HTTP, HTTPS, NFS and XROOT movers listen ports and interface.

Billing information from DCAP and FTP movers now on include local socket end point

### Poolmanager

Pnfsid and path options have been added to ac psu match.

Re-introduce `wrandom` partition type - a weighted-random pool selection partition, which works as a `WASS` partition, but ignores LRU metric and number of movers.

### QoS

Aside from bug fixes, the following significant changes to QoS should be noted:

-   QoS was made to support migration using a new pool mode, "DRAINING"; please consult the
    book chapter for further details.

-   The DB namespace endpoint can now be configured to be separate from the main Chimera
    database (originally introduced/changed for Resilience). In this way, the scanner,
    whose namespace queries are read-only, could be pointed at a database replica.

    This remains possible for QoS, even though the QoSEngine now also is responsible
    for updating Chimera with file policy state.  These writes are all done via
    messaging (PnfsHandler) rather than by direct DB connection, so they go to
    the master Chimera instance.

-   Requests for QoS transitions are now authorized on the basis of role (see under gPlazma).

-   The first version of the QoS Rule Engine has been added.   With this, one can
    define a QoS policy to apply to files either through a directory tag or via
    a requested transition; the engine tracks the necessary changes in state over time.
    A new database table has been added to the qos database.  Remember that if you are
    deploying QoS for the first time, you need to create the database:

    createdb -U \<user\> qos
    
    Fuller explanation of the rule/policy engine is forthcoming in the Book chapter.

-   In conformity with the new rule engine changes, the scanner has been modified in terms of
    how it runs scans.   There are now two types of system scans, the (NEARLINE) QoS scans
    (to ensure that files with a policy requiring them to be flushed have indeed been written
    to tape) and a system-wide ONLINE scan (there are two versions of this and an option to 
    choose which one).  Details in the Book; also refer to the relevant admin commands.

Note that the singleton QoS service (where all four components are plugged into each other 
directly) is no longer available; the four services can, however, still be run together or in
separate domains, as with any dCache cell.

### Resilience

Resilience is still available in 9.2, but should be considered as superseded by the
QoS services.   We encourage you to switch to the latter as soon as is feasible.
Remember *_not_* to run Resilience and QoS simultaneously.

A recipe has been added to the cookbook for migration/draining of resilient pools.
This continues to apply in QoS.

### WebDAV

The WebDAV door now provides limited support for metalink format.
Metalink is an XML format, described by RFC 5854, that describes how
to download multiple files.  The initial support is limited to
describing the files within the targeted directory: there is no
support for recursion.  The metalink information is available via HTTP
Content Negotiation (client sends a `Accept:
application/metalink4+xml` header) or via a `Link` HTTP response
header (see RFC 6249) when generating the normal HTML output.

### XRootD

Aside from bug fixes and various documentation additions and clarifications,
the following should be noted:

- Proxying through the xroot door is now available.
- Relative paths are supported in the xroot URL.
- Resolution of symlinks in path prefixes and paths is supported.
- The efficiency of the stat list (ls -l) has been greatly improved.

An Xroot User Guide page has been started.
