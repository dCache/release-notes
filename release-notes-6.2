## Release 6.2.2

### dcache

There have been several occasions where in a dCache instance using an embedded ZooKeeper server such HA services stopped working because 
an ephemeral node was elected leader that has no associated service anymore; it should have been deleted. 
This state might go undetected for a longer time, and removing such stale nodes in order for the services to continue functioning as intended requires manual intervention.

This is fixed now and the functioning of HA services using ZooKeeper-based leader elections is more reliable.

### resilience

A more robust handling of PSU changes which remove pool, unit or group
mappings was introduced.

Recently introduced improvements changed the way resilience handles file "removal"
(no longer setting the repository entry to 'removed'
but simply by caching the replica).
This change, however, did not take into account
the handling of broken files.  Encountering
a broken file, it would indiscriminately attempt
to remove it, whether it was cached or not;
this was leading to an infinite loop, with the
file operation continuously iterating without
doing any further work. This situation could potentially hang the pool scans
(if there are as many broken files as there are
scan threads), and even the file operation
queue. The current release fixed this issue and there is no  any potential for stalled
operations when encountering broken replicas.

## Release 6.2.1

### macaroons

Fixed macaroons validation where in case of multiple combined caveats for some of them only the digital signature was checked.

### resilience

If a FileOperation is canceled while its subtask is running a NullPointerException was thrown. This is now fixed.

### rpm

dCache rpm-package requires now Java 11.

### systemd

dCache forces now the use of systemctl on systemd-capable systems.

## Release 6.2.0

An optional telememetry service is added to collect dCache statistics by dCache.org. The `telemetry`
cell has to be explicitly defined in a layout file as well as enabled:

```
[telemetryDomain]
[telemetryDomain/telemetry]
telemetry.cell.enable=true
telemetry.instance.site-name=dCache instance on \${host.name}
telemetry.instance.location.latitude=53.5772
telemetry.instance.location.longitude=9.8772
```

The dcache version, online capacity, site name and optional location will be sent to the stats.dcache.org collector.

Starting from version 3.2.0 dcache domain processes can be managed as systemd services. However, this functionality was available for debian-based systems only. With version 6.2.0 systemd integration is added into RPM packages as well. The Debian based installations `must stop dcache.service` manually before installing new package. Please check the [documentation](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/docs/TheBook/src/main/markdown/install.md#using-systemd-service) for further information. To support RHEL-6 based systems, the legacy
sysV-like daemon still available.

### Billing

The data from the mover info message and door request message has been combined into a single message
when reporting to the kafka server. Kafka receives a request message type with mover info integrated,
if it exists.  A failed door request or a remove request (which also uses DoorRequestInfoMessage)
will simply have a ``null`` mover message field.

### Chimera

The minimal PosgreSQL version is changed to 9.5.
A new table `t_xattr (inumber, key, value)` is introduced to store user defined extended attributes.

### NFS

The embedded NFS server publiches itself as 4.2 protocol compatible.

Each NFS door gets an unique identifiert that becomes a part of nfs state ids. This prevents unlikely
event of nfs mover conflicts. The unique id for each door is stored in zookeeper as:

```
/dcache/nfs/doors/<cell>@<domain>/state-handler-id
```

The NFS transfer service was returning a multipath address list to nfs clients that contains duplicate entries. This was triggering kernel warnings like:

```
[Di Apr 23 13:50:01 2019] RPC:   addr 131.169.a.b already in xprt switch
[Di Apr 23 13:50:01 2019] RPC:   rpc_clnt_test_xprt failed: -98 addr 131.169.a.b not added
[Di Apr 23 13:50:02 2019] RPC:   addr 131.169.a.c already in xprt switch
[Di Apr 23 13:50:02 2019] RPC:   rpc_clnt_test_xprt failed: -98 addr 131.169.a.c not added
[Di Apr 23 13:55:00 2019] RPC:   addr 131.169.a.d already in xprt switch
[Di Apr 23 13:55:00 2019] RPC:   rpc_clnt_test_xprt failed: -98 addr 131.169.a.d not added
```

This is fixed now.

The discovery of an NFS4 domain, which is used by idmapper, is made more robust against invalid configurations of the dns resolver.
Improved throughput of parallel opens.

### Pool

Pools that use BerkeleyDBReplicaStore have impoved startup time by reducing the number of stat requests to the underlying filesystem.

### SRM / SRM Manager

Removed `hidden` possibility to generate perfomance HTML reports and plots.

### Telemetry

An optional telememetry service is added to collect dCache statistics by dCache.org.

### Transfer Manager

### WebDAV

A Webdav door can pass `xattr.` prefixed url params as extended attributes to a pool. For example:

```
    $ curl --upload-file file.txt \
        https://localhost:2881/tape/file.txt?xattr.key1=value1&xattr.key2=value2"
```
This information will be available to an HSM as part of the storage info.

### XRootD

TLS can now be enabled for connections to both door and pool.   Please read the documentation
in _The Book_ for details (https://dcache.org/old/manuals/Book-6.2/config-xrootd.shtml#tls).  There
is also further information in the xrootd.properties file.

SciToken support has been added to the xrootd door.  Please read the documentation
in _The Book_ for details (https://dcache.org/old/manuals/Book-6.2/config-xrootd.shtml, under "SciTokens").
There is also further information in the xrootd.properties file.

When using TPC with GSI, the option to fall back to generating a proxy from the
host certificate or to use a proxy provided at a given path instead of a delegated one,
can cause issues if third-party source endpoints do not have a mapping for the
proxy DN.  Before 6.2, this fallback was automatic, but with 6.2 it can be controlled
via the property

```
    xrootd.gsi.tpc.delegation-only=true
```

Turn on fallback (set this property to false) only if you are certain all potential
endpoints will recognize the alternate DN.

As a reminder:  we have also changed the dCache door to behave like the xrootd server
and create missing directories (see [229210209c]); the default pool plugin has also
been changed to ``unix`` (rather than undefined), as this is needed for TPC with dCache
and EOS sources (but is otherwise ignored): see [a5482ad5f2]).


### Zookeeper

The ZooKeeper ensemble which is used by dCache is required to be of version 3.5. Version 3.4 will no longer be supported.

### Cleaner

The Cleaner cell may be run in high availability mode. Several Cleaners negotiate leadership via ZooKeeper and only the leader is active at any point in time. When the leader disappears, a new leader is elected automatically.
