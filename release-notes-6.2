<h1>What's new in dCache 6.2<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

 - Improved pool startup time with BerkeleyDB medadata repository
 - Basis support for extended attributes
 - Java 11 runtime required
 - TLS support for xrootd
 - SciToken support with XRootD
 - New telemetry service
 - Running dcache domains as systemd services for RPM based distros
 - The Cleaner cell may be run in high availability mode

## Incompatibilities

 - Minimal PostgreSQL version is 9.5
 - From now on dCache requires Java 11 for runtime
 - dCache now requires ZooKeeper version 3.5
 - The systemd dcache.service replaced by dcache.target
 - Dropped compatibiity with EGEE rpms
 
### Note:

By increasing the required Java runtime version to 11, a new set of
warnings is logged on startup, such as:

```
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by [...]
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of [...]
WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal
reflective access operations
WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
```

They are generated by third party libraries which use a type of reflection
that will no longer be supported in future Java releases. These libraries
are expected to be updated in the future.
This does not affect functionality.

## Release 6.2.38

### gplazma

dCache will now reject WLCG-AuthZ-JWT profile tokens with a 'wlcg.ver'
claim that it does not support. Other tokens (e.g., SciTokens) are
unaffected by this change.

### loginbroker

This patch fixes SRM based upload or download where the client requests an
xroot-based transfer. The SRM door will now also consider any xroot
door with xrootd.security.tls.mode configured to OPTIONAL when
building a TURL targeting either xroot or xroots protocols.

### pnfsmanager

PnfsManager now has two commands, 'reset chimera stats' and 'reset stats',
to support resetting the gauge and counter statistics available through
the 'info' command.

dCache no longer leaks information about whether or not files exist when
using macaroons or Scitokens / WLCG AuthZ JWT profile tokens.

### webdav

The WebDAV door cannot send the HTTP response to some HTTP request if
the client has already disconnected. dCache no longer logs an error
that it cannot send the HTTP response.

A client that disconnects during a proxied HTTP transfer (GET or PUT) is
no longer logged in the WebDAV door's log file; instead, it is logged in
the cell's pinboard. The billing message is updated to make it clearer
what went wrong.

A better error message is logged when attempting to use a password-protected credential:
`java.io.IOException: Error decrypting private key: the password is incorrect or the PEM data is corrupted.`

### webdav

The HTTP-TPC should have fewer failed transfers when faced with many
short-lived transfers.

It's now possible to access a summary of HTTP-TPC transfers and
configuration information via the WebDAV door's info admin command.

transfer.

### gplazma

The `scitoken` gplazma plugin now supports extracting the `sub` and
`wlcg.groups` claims in the same fashion as the `oidc` plugin.

### pool

The current release fixed open queue flag when template defined by `queue define class` issue.

### webdav


The WebDAV door's `http-tpc ls` command now has the possibility to show
the current state of the transfer. This may be useful diagnosing
transfers spending a lot of time deciding on which pool to transfer
should take place.

## Release 6.2.35

### dcache-core


The current release fixed  NPE in TransferManager when no pool was selected before transfer is cancelled.

### frontend

The current release fixed handling of SRR requests over IPv6.

### gplazma


The scitoken plugin now supports OPs that publish their public keys
without any corresponding ID (i.e., no kid value).


### pinmanager


A more detailed pinmanager log entry is provided for pin requests that
are caught in a retry loop, and eventually time out.

### resilience

A runtime exception triggered by side effect of logging has been fixed.

### storagedescriptor



The script for generating SRR records (from the info service output) has
been updated. The field `lastupdated` has been adjusted to the correct
name `latestupdate`.



### webdav

A bug is fixed where HTTP-TPC PULL request can fail (under heavy load)
with the downloaded file being deleted, but dCache reports the transfer
as successful.


dCache now  provides a faster respones to the HTTP-TPC client (typically FTS)
should the door decide to fail a transfer.

The WebDAV door should be now  faster at accepting new transfers and faster
at handling transfer completions when handling many small transfers.


The HTTP-TPC support in the WebDAV door is now e more robust to high
number of transfers finishing concurrently.


### xroot


Now it is possible to support kXR_delete as a write request on the pool.

### xrootd4j

Library updates for xrootd4j which contains fix for Unix Protocol.

The HTTP-TPC response is improved if a client attempts to pull a file
into a non-existing directory, or attempts to use an existing file as an
ancestor directory.

### xrootd

Improved exception handling for Xrootd.

## Release 6.2.32

### billing


Billing will no longer throw a NullPointerException with certain
information from an NFS door serving an NFSv3 client.



### ftp


Now  file sizes for LIST output in bytes is displayed.



The FTP door should be more robust against a (currently unknown) bug
that results in the ftp session attempting to send progress queries to
the pool after that is no longer possible.




### gplazma



The banfile and scitoken plugins, and the two admin commands test login and explain login are updated to accept the username: prefix
(e.g., username:paul). The prefix user: continues to work but is
now deprecated.

### pool


The current release improved error messaging if a setup file badly
configures an HSM instance.


A bug is fixed where removing a create hsm statement in a pool's setup
file and running the reload command kills the pool.


### xroot


The documentation  concerning TLS properties has been fixed.

## Release 6.2.31

### acl


The group ACEs now  apply to desired group instead of to a users with the
same numeric id.

### gplazma

The `WLCG Common JWT Profiles` (v1.0) describes the `wlcg.groups` claim
for expressing group-membership. We are increasingly seeing this being
used as the OIDC equivalent to the group-membership expressed through
the VOMS extension.

During the auth phase of the login process, the group membership
information contained in a `wlcg.groups` claim from the OP is now
available as OpenIdGroupPrincipal principals. Subsequent plugins (e.g.,
multimap) may be used to convert these principals to more directly
useful principals.

### webdav

dCache now responds with a 507 (Insufficient Storage) on GET request if
dCache must do a pool-to-pool internal-transfer or stage the file but no
pools have sufficient free capacity to support this.

## Release 6.2.28

### dcache-xroot

The next release of xrootd4j is used now, which improves handling TPC
read requests.

### namespace-chimera

There are less operations on the database now as the filesize doesn't
get updated after a file was flushed to tape.

### pool, webdav

The webdav admin interface has been extended to include monitoring
information about on-going transfers. The command can optionally show
pool information if transfer-manager is update; updating
transfer-manager is not required by this change. Percent transfer
progress for PULL requests is optionally available if pools are updated;
updating pools is not required by this change.

## Release 6.2.27

### pnfsmanager

Fixed a problem where dCache accepts a HSM script that, when called to
flush a file, returns successfully but without providing any URIs on
stdout. Such requests are considered failed, with the flush request
blocked until retried explicitly with the queue activate PNFSID
admin command.


### pool

The Kafka message emitted when a file is flushed to tape or staged back
from tape now includes the locations field: a JSON array of JSON
Strings, where each JSON String is a tape-location URL.
For flush operations, this is the (potentially empty, potentially multiple)
list of URLs returned by the HSM instance.
For stage operations, this is the (potentially empty, potentially multiple)
URLs that match the selected HSM instance. Both messages now also
describe a hsm JSON Object that contain the HSM type, HSM instance name,
and HSM provider.


### srmmanager

A race condition is fixed that, if triggered, results in a memory leak.
This leak can also affect the TURLs returned by SrmManager, where
out-of-date information about doors is used.

## Release 6.2.26

### alarms

Clearer documentation for billing/alarms services regarding HA requirements.



### gplazma

dCache has a new session gPlazma plugin that is designed to be a viable
alternative to the StorageAuthzDB and KPWD plugins but with shorter
(hopefully less confusing) configuration, while also being more
flexible.


To support the removal of authzdb plugin, we should provide an easy way
for sites to migrate their existing configuration from using authzdb (as
a session plugin) to omnisession.

Sites now have a utility to help them migrating from authzdb to
omnisession.

Note: it is also possible to use the authzdb plugin as a mapping plugin.
This utility does not help in migrating that use to some alternative
solution.

### skel

Whether a cell/service supports HA or not can
now be derived from the properties file (except
for doors).

Please see `<name>.cell.replicable`.


### srm


The access log file for SRM requests now includes the client-supplied
list of protocols, if any were provided.

## Release 6.2.25

### dcache-core


The old web pages claim the transfer size and speed are reported in KB and KB/s, although the actually used units are KiB and KiB/s. 
Reporting the correct unit is important for monitoring. This is now fixed.

### frontend

The current release fixed regression in generating swagger JSON for frontend's REST API.

### gplazma

dCache may now be configured so that the multimap `oidc` predicates
match the `sub` claim value from a specific OAuth2 Provider using the
format SUBVALUE@OP, where `OP` is the dCache-internal alias for the OP.
Existing multimap configuration continues to work, but admin is warned
to update the multimap configuration.

The current release fixed the parsing to account for host/error pairs.


Upload transfer checksum failure is fixed and the gfal scenario now works.

### xrootd

xrootd4j is updated to new version which fixed problem with netty LogHandler slowing down TPC client
(cutting bandwidth by a factor of 10).

## Release 6.2.22

### ftp


Globus transfer agent is now able to create symbolic links.

### nfs

The current release introduced  `nfs.clientdb.config` property prefix to populate the
BerkeleyDB configuration and now 
    the nfs door is not picky about free disk space in /var/lib/dcache/nfs
and     the BerkeleyDB used as client store by nfs door can be configured
    with properties.


### pool

dCacheView now works for redirected transfers for non-anonymous data
access, provided the WebDAV door is using TLS encryption and is
configured with 'webdav.redirect.allow-https' set to 'true'. 


### poolmanager


A very rare race-condition is fixed that could be triggered if a pool
completes a stage or pool-to-pool request (to satisfy a client's read
request) immediately before dying.

### webdav

dCacheView is able to view and download files when authenticated and
when the WebDAV door proxies the transfer.

## Release 6.2.21

### frontend


frontend/api readers and writers always zero issue is fixed now

The LDAP plugin behaviuor now more closely follows that of other mapping
plugins. This allows deployments where LDAP is tried first and, if that
fails to identify the user, fall-back strategies are used.

### pool

The  pool size reporting when static/runtime config is not defined now is improved.

## Release 6.2.19

### nearline-storage

The current release fixed  store cancel regression.

### pool

As in distributed system packet loss (due to timeout or re-connects)
can't be avoid, dCache retries many of requests. However, this is not
the case for mover redirects. If a door did not receive reqirect
information, then transfer will never happen.
This is now fixed and re-send redirect if client is not connected within 5sec.

### poolmanager

When poolmanager requests that a pool stage a file, the pool may return
the special error code HSM_DELAY_ERROR (10013). On receiving this
error, poolmanager suspends the request.

This is now fixed.

## Release 6.2.18

### pool

There are several cases when pool scans the various hsm queus:
 on mover start, to check load assumptions,  on heartbeat, to populate pool manager with load information,
 on `info` command, to report load numbers to admin interface of   dcache-view collectors

As this is O(n) operation, in case of a large queues those scans
might take seconds, which is unacceptable, especially wen starting
a new mover. 

This is now fixed and getting hsm start is O(1) and doesn't impact pools operation

### xrootd


Now the door will ignore `xrootd.enable.tried-hosts` property if property false instead of returning errror.

## Release 6.2.16

### Changes affecting multiple services

Sometimes file checksums are missing in namespace. Transfer requiring checksum verification fails then with an error saying that "No checksums found", but doesn't log a stack trace server side anymore.

### dcache-xroot

During periods of heavy usage on a pool node, if I/O stalls during read, the xroot client may try to reconnect and continue reading. This release fixes a bug which fails the transfer on the attempted reconnect with a "uuid no longer valid" error (because the file mover has already been closed and removed).  Clients should now be able to resume reading the file on retry.

## Release 6.2.15

### admin

The current release fixed  doors `login dump cache` admin command  to show the
information sent by the door along with the login result.

### common

Printing of bearer tokens is improved to provide better assurance that
bearer tokens are not leaked.

### gplazma

All login failures are now recoreded in pinboard as a single-line
summary, explaining why the login attempt failed.

### namespace

Now Path information available for all transfers.

### webdav

The current release fixed  a regression where dCache would complain about badly formatted IPv6
addresses, preventing those addresses from being included in the access
log files.

The current release fixed a regression where dCache would complain about badly formatted IPv6
addresses, preventing those addresses from being included in the access
log files.

### xroot

The current relase updated xrootd4j to 4.0.5 which fixes improper use of destination token when
contacting source server during third-pary transfer.

longer results in an endless loop, with transfermanager logging a
message every ~5 seconds per ongoing HTTP-TPC transfer.

## Release 6.2.13

### biiling

The current relase fixed  unit info for bandwidth measurements in billing.properties (bytes/sec, not MiB/sec).

### frontend

Frontend now logs any time it returns 500 Internal Server Error to the
client.

dcache-view Previously displayed   MB/sec for transfer rate, but the
value is the old KB/sec. This is now improved and pages display the values advertised.


### pool

Less memory consumption by pool, especially on startup.

The current release assures  now  that  checksum scanner wiill mark files broken and sends alarm.


### webdav

An HTTP-TPC transfer will abort automatically if transfer-manager is
restarted, without waiting for the client (FTS) to time-out.

## Release 6.2.12

### book


A new section is added to the xrootd chapter explaining the need for
SAN extensions on the hostcert in the case of hostname aliasing.

### ftp

Globus transfer service can now list directories that contain incomplete
files, those that are still being uploaded.

The FTP no longer leaking sockets when dynamically calculating file
checksums (e.g., MD5). In practise, this issue only affects transfers
via the Globus transfer service.

The current release fixed  Globus transfer service directory listing for `medium` size
directories.

The current release fixed  Globus transfers hanging when `verify file integrity after transfer`
is enabled and the pool is not configured to calculate an MD5 checksum.

Honour the `ftp.net.internal` configuration property for dynamic
checksum calculation.

## Release 6.2.11

### nfs

The new version of nfs4j-0.21.1 fixed readdir reply size miscalculation for NFSv3.

### pool

The current release fix a problem where, under heavy load, redirected https transfers result
in garbled SSL information, preventing the HTTP client from working.

### services

Recovery processe in the case where a pool's message queue is overloaded,
as old (and now useless) requests may be simply discarded is improved.


### vehicles

The current release improved  memory consumption on pools.

### webdav

There were  reports of the access log file missing entries. This problem
seems to be triggered if the client disconnects before dCache has
finished processing the request, which is certainly true for cancelled
HTTP-TPC transfers. This is now fixed.

### xrootd

xrootd4j-authz-plugin-alice is updated to 1.2.0.

The xroot protocol access log entries for the xrootd door and pool have
been enhanced to include information about the kXR_query requests.

## Release 6.2.10

The current release fixes EGI-SVG-2020-16939 vulnerabilities.



## Release 6.2.9

### dcache

The log files now can be enforced even with systemd deployments.

`dcache.log.destination` property has been introduced which  controls the log
destination. The default value `console` preserves the current
behaviour: systemd services log to journald, system-V services log to
stdout (redirected to /var/log/dcache/.log).

The option `file` instruct logback to send message to the location
defined by `dcache.log.file` property. The plain file FileAppender is
used as dCache packages already comes with pre-defined logrotate
configuration.

### xrootd

The xrootd4j version was updated to 4.0.4.

## Release 6.2.8

### common-auth

Fix regression introduced by limiting UidPrincipal to be only an output principal.

### pool

The mover thread is not interrupted outside of IO activity to avoid disabling of repository.

HTTP-TPC transfers where dCache pushes data to an Apache server (for example as used by Dynafed) will now work for zero-length files.

### webdav

HTTPS-PUT requests are now possible.

## Release 6.2.6

### nfs

If door failed to start a mover due to timeout or `no route to cell`,
then pool selection or mover start is retried. However, as the retry
procedure in the transfer class was not idempotent, the `nfs` door has
it's own workaround to avoid extra pool selection. This partial
solution plays not well with retry logic of transfer class and
produced inconsistent results. 
This is fixed now and lost messages to start mover successfully delivered after number of retries.

### pool


The HTTP-TPC PUSH requests (which use the HTTP PUT request to send data)
are now more robust against slow remote servers that redirect the
transfer.

The current release fixed  NullPointerException bug in MongoDB-backed pool metadata storage 
and SpotBugs NORMAL-level warning.

With the chenges introduced in current release, when using HTTP-TPC, the timeouts dCache pool uses when requesting
information from the remote server have been adjusted, based on
operational experience. In general, dCache will now wait longer for the
remote server to complete any post-processing before giving up and
failing the transfer.

## Release 6.2.2

### dcache

There have been several occasions where in a dCache instance using an embedded ZooKeeper server such HA services stopped working because 
an ephemeral node was elected leader that has no associated service anymore; it should have been deleted. 
This state might go undetected for a longer time, and removing such stale nodes in order for the services to continue functioning as intended requires manual intervention.

This is fixed now and the functioning of HA services using ZooKeeper-based leader elections is more reliable.

### resilience

A more robust handling of PSU changes which remove pool, unit or group
mappings was introduced.

Recently introduced improvements changed the way resilience handles file "removal"
(no longer setting the repository entry to 'removed'
but simply by caching the replica).
This change, however, did not take into account
the handling of broken files.  Encountering
a broken file, it would indiscriminately attempt
to remove it, whether it was cached or not;
this was leading to an infinite loop, with the
file operation continuously iterating without
doing any further work. This situation could potentially hang the pool scans
(if there are as many broken files as there are
scan threads), and even the file operation
queue. The current release fixed this issue and there is no  any potential for stalled
operations when encountering broken replicas.

## Release 6.2.0

An optional telememetry service is added to collect dCache statistics by dCache.org. The `telemetry`
cell has to be explicitly defined in a layout file as well as enabled:

```
[telemetryDomain]
[telemetryDomain/telemetry]
telemetry.cell.enable=true
telemetry.instance.site-name=dCache instance on \${host.name}
telemetry.instance.location.latitude=53.5772
telemetry.instance.location.longitude=9.8772
```

The dcache version, online capacity, site name and optional location will be sent to the stats.dcache.org collector.

Starting from version 3.2.0 dcache domain processes can be managed as systemd services. However, this functionality was available for debian-based systems only. With version 6.2.0 systemd integration is added into RPM packages as well. The Debian based installations `must stop dcache.service` manually before installing new package. Please check the [documentation](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/docs/TheBook/src/main/markdown/install.md#using-systemd-service) for further information. To support RHEL-6 based systems, the legacy
sysV-like daemon still available.

### Billing

The data from the mover info message and door request message has been combined into a single message
when reporting to the kafka server. Kafka receives a request message type with mover info integrated,
if it exists.  A failed door request or a remove request (which also uses DoorRequestInfoMessage)
will simply have a ``null`` mover message field.

### Chimera

The minimal PosgreSQL version is changed to 9.5.
A new table `t_xattr (inumber, key, value)` is introduced to store user defined extended attributes.

### NFS

The embedded NFS server publiches itself as 4.2 protocol compatible.

Each NFS door gets an unique identifiert that becomes a part of nfs state ids. This prevents unlikely
event of nfs mover conflicts. The unique id for each door is stored in zookeeper as:

```
/dcache/nfs/doors/<cell>@<domain>/state-handler-id
```

The NFS transfer service was returning a multipath address list to nfs clients that contains duplicate entries. This was triggering kernel warnings like:

```
[Di Apr 23 13:50:01 2019] RPC:   addr 131.169.a.b already in xprt switch
[Di Apr 23 13:50:01 2019] RPC:   rpc_clnt_test_xprt failed: -98 addr 131.169.a.b not added
[Di Apr 23 13:50:02 2019] RPC:   addr 131.169.a.c already in xprt switch
[Di Apr 23 13:50:02 2019] RPC:   rpc_clnt_test_xprt failed: -98 addr 131.169.a.c not added
[Di Apr 23 13:55:00 2019] RPC:   addr 131.169.a.d already in xprt switch
[Di Apr 23 13:55:00 2019] RPC:   rpc_clnt_test_xprt failed: -98 addr 131.169.a.d not added
```

This is fixed now.

The discovery of an NFS4 domain, which is used by idmapper, is made more robust against invalid configurations of the dns resolver.
Improved throughput of parallel opens.

### Pool

Pools that use BerkeleyDBReplicaStore have impoved startup time by reducing the number of stat requests to the underlying filesystem.

### SRM / SRM Manager

Removed `hidden` possibility to generate perfomance HTML reports and plots.

### Telemetry

An optional telememetry service is added to collect dCache statistics by dCache.org.

### Transfer Manager

### WebDAV

A Webdav door can pass `xattr.` prefixed url params as extended attributes to a pool. For example:

```
    $ curl --upload-file file.txt \
        https://localhost:2881/tape/file.txt?xattr.key1=value1&xattr.key2=value2"
```
This information will be available to an HSM as part of the storage info.

### XRootD

TLS can now be enabled for connections to both door and pool.   Please read the documentation
in _The Book_ for details (https://dcache.org/old/manuals/Book-6.2/config-xrootd.shtml#tls).  There
is also further information in the xrootd.properties file.

SciToken support has been added to the xrootd door.  Please read the documentation
in _The Book_ for details (https://dcache.org/old/manuals/Book-6.2/config-xrootd.shtml, under "SciTokens").
There is also further information in the xrootd.properties file.

When using TPC with GSI, the option to fall back to generating a proxy from the
host certificate or to use a proxy provided at a given path instead of a delegated one,
can cause issues if third-party source endpoints do not have a mapping for the
proxy DN.  Before 6.2, this fallback was automatic, but with 6.2 it can be controlled
via the property

```
    xrootd.gsi.tpc.delegation-only=true
```

Turn on fallback (set this property to false) only if you are certain all potential
endpoints will recognize the alternate DN.

As a reminder:  we have also changed the dCache door to behave like the xrootd server
and create missing directories (see [229210209c]); the default pool plugin has also
been changed to ``unix`` (rather than undefined), as this is needed for TPC with dCache
and EOS sources (but is otherwise ignored): see [a5482ad5f2]).


### Zookeeper

The ZooKeeper ensemble which is used by dCache is required to be of version 3.5. Version 3.4 will no longer be supported.

### Cleaner

The Cleaner cell may be run in high availability mode. Several Cleaners negotiate leadership via ZooKeeper and only the leader is active at any point in time. When the leader disappears, a new leader is elected automatically.
